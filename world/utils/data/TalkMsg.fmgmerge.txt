###1000002
You fought bravely on my behalf.

###1000003
I cannot throw away such loyalty.

###1000004
Loyal Wolf, take my blood and live again.

###1000100
Father? Mother?

###1000101
The butterflies -- everyone is gone.

###1000102
My Lord!

###1000103
Illusion technique.

###1000105
It's been a long time...

###1000106
Son of Owl.

###1000107###34030000###34061000
Lady Butterfly...

###1000108
Leave us.

###1000109
Who... are...

###1000110###23111605
Do what must be done.

###1000111###10001802
...Yes.

###1000112
Now then, son of Owl. Shall we dance?

###1100001
...What is this?

###1100002
So, you're awake.

###1100003
Looks like death is not your fate... just yet.

###1100100
Close your eyes. Hear the bell speak to you.

###1100101
The bell's chime will stir your thoughts...

###1100102
...and awaken old memories from their slumber.

###1100200
(Sculptor coughing)

###1100201
Unnnnghh...

###1100202
So... you're awake.

###1100203
Your death is not your fate...

###1100204
just yet.

###1101000
How is grandfather?

###1101001
Lord Isshin is... it's a wonder he is still with us.  A miracle.

###1101002
...is that so.

###1101003
Divine Heir, I'll ask you once more.

###1101004
Accept me into your immortal oath.

###1101005
I cannot do that, Lord Genichiro.

###1101006
Your victory that day means nothing.

###1101007
He will risk his life to take me home.

###1101008
For he is my shinobi.

###1101009
My Lord, I have come for you.

###1101010###25000000
This...

###1101011
will only take a moment.

###1101012###10001804###10080804###11010300###11111203###13010404###22001414###22011917###23102313###23110110###23111822###24010509###32010005
I see.

###1101013
 For as long as you are alive...

###1101014
The dragon's blood can never be mine. 

###1101100
Impressive, Shinobi of the Divine Heir.

###1101101
But you deserve better.

###1101102
Would you not answer to a different lord?

###1101103
Heresy.

###1101104
Heresy, you say?

###1101105
If it is for the sake of preserving Ashina,

###1101106
I will seize any manner of heretical strength.

###1101107
I will endure any burden.

###1101108
Behold, the Lightning of Tomoe.

###1101200
You were victorious, I see.

###1101201
Are you...?

###1101202
I mean you no harm.

###1101203
Shinobi of the Divine Heir... (!)

###1101204
Lord Genichiro... is this... the rejuvenating waters? 

###1101205
Ashina, this land -- is everything to me.

###1101206
For her sake...

###1101207
I will shed humanity itself.

###1101208
Resurrection.

###1101209
Yes... indeed.

###1101210###14120400
So long.

###1101300
I remember you well.

###1101301
I heard stories of your death, yet here you are. 

###1101302
What are you plotting, Owl?

###1101303
Plotting? I would do no such thing.

###1101304
Now, my lord. I must ask that you accompany me.

###1101305
This old bird has but one desire. 

###1101306
To protect the Divine Heir from those who might take his esteemed blood.

###1101307
So, the Dragon's Heritage has seduced you, too?

###1101308
Then there is nothing to discuss.

###1101309
Take your leave.

###1101310
I would, my lord, but...

###1101311
I'm so stunned by this view, I'd like to take it in just a while longer.

###1101312
I'll leave when I've had my fill.

###1101400
Why, boy?

###1101401
Why can't you understand your father's will?

###1101402
Have you forgotten the Shinobi Code?

###1101403
A code must be determined by the individual...

###1101404
This is what I've decided.

###1101405
Just as my master did.

###1101406
Hmm.

###1101407
Seems you've grown, if just a little. 

###1101408
Have it your way...

###1101409
Young Wolf.

###1101500###24060301
Sekiro...

###1101501
You were a most unkind and inauspicious man...

###1101502
but for some reason I could not bring myself to hate you.

###1101504
It seems...

###1101505
I must cut you down before you fall to Shura.

###1101600
I expected no less from you, my boy.

###1101601
With this, our supreme reign will...

###1101603
It seems we have a... troubling guest.

###1101604
But to oppose the daughter of the late Lord Dougen

###1101605
Would be quite the insult.

###1101606
A disgrace!

###1101607
My, my...

###1101608
Not bad at all.

###1101609
Wolf. I leave this to you.

###1101610
Have at it. Tear her apart.

###1101611
Sir.

###1101612
I have witnessed Shura once before.

###1101613
The very same stirs inside of you.

###1101614
As such, you must be destroyed.

###1101700
That took a while...

###1101701
but it was well worth the wait.

###1101702
Despite his age, few could hope to defeat a man such as Isshin.

###1101703
I would expect no less from my own.

###1101704
Now, nothing stands in our way.

###1101705
Ashina, the Interior Ministers--

###1101706
the whole country is ours for the taking! 

###1101707
I, Ukonzaemon Usu--

###1101710
Wh--

###1101711
Why... why would you...

###1101712
(!) Shura...!

###1101714
...No, you're...

###1101715
You can't be Shura...!

###1101716
Soldiers and townfolk alike died by the thousands.

###1101717
Very few survived.

###1101718
Ashina became the setting for the most tragic massacre of the Sengoku era. 

###1101719
And for a long time after, it was said a demon lurked the land...

###1101800###1102503###1102803###11160200###18000300###26910201###30900108###38030000###38031000###39030000###39031000###40030000###40031000###70003100###70053000###70060103###90000000###90000001
 

###1101801###11104710
... It's over now, Wolf.

###1101900###11110924
Lord Takeru's dragon blood...

###1101901###11110925
Lives on with you.

###1101902###2000302###11110926###22031006
I humbly accept.

###1101903###1102908###10001302###11103903###11103911###11110709###11110805###11110927###11110933###11111237###11250208###12000015###13000701###16000304###18010000###18010200###18010300###22001203###22001401###22001405###22002101###22002419###22003416###22003702###22004917###22030906###22031003###23001217###23002124###23002831###23002902###23010003###23010708###23010733###23101402###23102304###23110009###24100201###26010702###26011202###27010005###27010106###29000201###29000701###30010302###30100501###30210303###30910007###31010200###39000001###48000002###70020001
Yes.

###1101904###2000304###10000901###10002500###10003100###10003108###10003400###10003600###10011411###10011825###10011903###10011914###10011920###10012115###10012119###10012400###10012800###10080604###10080700###10080800###10090111###10090206###11000030###11103308###11104702###11104713###11105000###11105100###11110703###11110928###11111050###11111270###11111516###11111704###11112100###11150510###11160003###12030600###13000002###13000208###13000403###13001403###14100207###14100612###14200011###14200018###14200203###14200606###14210000###14901200###15010200###15010300###16000200###16900304###16900307###16900504###16910011###16910100###17001410###17001807###17001812###17002000###17010900###17011016###17100201###17100205###17910200###18010100###18900203###18910200###22001452###22002606###22002617###22003302###22003400###22004802###22010500###22010700###22010900###22011004###22011006###22011104###22011106###22011200###22011505###22011605###22012005###22012095###22030704###22030907###22031008###23000504###23000914###23001220###23001700###23001706###23001711###23001804###23003003###23010500###23010705###23100310###23100504###23102103###23102105###23102108###23110205###23110500###23111416###23111500###23111604###23111813###23111905###23111906###23112009###23112014###23112118###24000215###24000515###24000607###24000700###24000801###24010011###24010206###24011101###24011201###24011510###24060300###24100001###24100005###26001107###26010500###26900704###26910100###26910200###27010100###27010406###27910100###28010100###28010300###29000902###29010009###29010100###29010208###29900202###29900302###29910008###29910100###30010100###30010205###30100506###30110100###30110300###30210100###30910100###31001001###31002008###31002010###31002012###31010100###31010207###31900004###31900204###31900400###31910106###31910300###31910400###31910500###32000203###32000500###32000502###32010007###32010100###36000800###36101000###41900200###42900200###43900200###44900200###45900200###46900200###47900200###70040100
.........

###1101905###11110929
You may open your eyes now.

###1101906###11104700###11104900###11110923###11110930###11111223
My Lord...

###1102002
Is that all a shinobi has to offer? 

###1102003
The Divine Heir will be coming with me.

###1102100
Some twenty years after Isshin's coup, the Ashina clan --

###1102101
was on the brink of collapse.

###1102102
And the shinobi known as Wolf had lost everything --

###1102103
Both the man who took him in and the boy he had sworn to protect...

###1102104###30030500###30030601
Shinobi...

###1102105
Open your eyes.

###1102106
For the sake of your master...

###1102201
You did well to come here.

###1102202
It's been too long, Wolf.

###1102203
I've come to free you, my lord.

###1102204
Well then--

###1102205
Raise your head.

###1102206
Kusabimaru -- your sword.

###1102207
My shinobi.

###1102208
In accordance with the bond of lord and retainer--

###1102209
you will pledge your life in my service.

###1102210
As you command.

###1102301
Wolf, you found it.

###1102302
Now, let us leave this place.

###1102303###11103915###11103923
Yes, my lord.

###1102304
To think that this is the only way--

###1102305
 to run from the fated bloodline is the only answer...

###1102400
The Divine Heir... 

###1102401
Last we stood together was your uncle's funeral.

###1102402###8000009###11150302
Lord Genichiro...

###1102403
I--

###1102404###20000104###22011701###23003203###23010205###23010405###23010738###23100715
Thank you.

###1102405
Leave this to me.

###1102406
So the noble shinobi stands in our way...

###1102501
...In the end, I was powerless, but--

###1102502
Ashina will rise once more...

###1102504
The Dragon Blood surging through her veins.

###1102505
With this, Ashina's long night comes to an end.

###1102507
Pitiful grandchild...

###1102508
This was your last wish.

###1102509
To see Ashina returned from the great beyond...

###1102510
which means, Sekiro...

###1102511
I must destroy you.

###1102601
Lord Kuro!

###1102602
Shinobi of the Divine Heir. We meet again.

###1102603
Behold! The second Mortal Blade.

###1102604
Genichiro...

###1102605
If you think you can change Ashina's fate with such a thing...

###1102606
you are mistaken.

###1102607###11104500###11104509###11150001
Wolf...

###1102608
No one has the right to the Dragon's Heritage - it is no one's to bear.

###1102609
...I wish there was another way.

###1102610
It's alright.

###1102611
...One last time.

###1102612
Yes, let's finish this.

###1102700
Bastard...

###1102702
A shinobi would know the difference between honor and victory.

###1102703
The Divine Heir is coming with me.

###1102800
Wolf...where are you?

###1102801###1102901###1103001
I am at your side.

###1102802
...Take the Dragon Tears.

###1102804
My sworn shinobi, now...

###1102805
Sever these ties of immortality.

###1102806
I think it is best that you have this.

###1102807
No doubt the day will come--

###1102808
when a Shinobi arrives, seeking strength.

###1102900
Wolf... where are you?

###1102902###1103002
Take the Dragon Tears.

###1102905
I hereby condemn the last immortal.

###1102906
May you live on, and embrace what it means to be human.

###1102907
So, you're leaving?

###1102909
I, too, will live for every moment--

###1102910
and then I will pass on.

###1102911
Just as my shinobi did for me...

###1102912
Lady Emma, I owe much to you as well.

###1103000
Wolf...where..where are you?

###1103005
We must leave this place, my lord.

###1103006
Lord Kuro, may you be at rest.

###1103007
Allow me to hold you in my heart.

###1103008
Everyone, it is time.

###1103009
I must depart.

###1103010
The journey to sever our ties with fate...

###1103011
will be a very long one indeed.

###1103012
And yet, you still wish to join us?

###1103013###22010400
I do.

###1103014
You have my thanks, Shinobi of the Dragon.

###1103015
Know that Kuro shares my joy.

###1103016
...Let us depart to the west.

###1103017
To the birthplace of the Divine Dragon...

###1500000
The Fountainhead Palace.

###2000000
Three monkeys...

###2000001
One of the panels is empty.

###2000002
(Grunts)

###2000100
Please, forgive them.  

###2000101
They only sought to keep me hidden.

###2000102
However, it seems it was not meant to be.

###2000103###11104707###11110922
Close your eyes.

###2000104
Let us meet at the Inner Sanctum.

###2000200
If you are prepared,

###2000201
you may gaze upon the blade.

###2000203
Why is it, I wonder. Are they not loath to die?

###2000205
How... how are you?

###2000206
Your eye...

###2000207
I see. You carry the curse of the Dragon's Heritage.

###2000208###13010700###23002842
The Mortal Blade.

###2000209
Without question...

###2000210
I accept its power.

###2000300###22031004
May this Sakura Droplet...

###2000301###22031005
Bring you strength.

###2000303###22031007
There.

###2000305###22031009
You can open your eyes.

###2000306###12000013###22005102###22031010###23000655###23002113###23002504###23002603###23010055###23010100###23101123
Understood.

###2500000
The divine realm...

###2500100
Divine Dragon...

###2500101
I humbly receive your blessing.

###6000000
Three Years Ago

###7000003###10011208###10011301
Your master yet lives.

###7000004
Though they will use his blood quite soon, I imagine.

###7000005
The limb you have lost will give way to something more... useful.

###7000006
You'll learn to appreciate it's worth.

###8000000
In the closing years of the Sengoku Era,

###8000001
Japan was consumed by perpetual conflict.

###8000002
The fires of war raged on,

###8000003
spreading deep into the mountains--

###8000004
to the land of Ashina.

###8000023
... Is the war finally over?

###8000026
(Nngahh! Muahh! Gnnhh!) *different variations

###8000051
General Tamura is no more!

###8000052
People of Ashina, we are victorious!

###8000053
Master swordsman, Isshin Ashina...

###8000054
staged a bloody coup and wrested control of the land.

###8000055
What's the matter, stray? Nothing left to lose?

###8000056
Well, would you look at that.

###8000057
... Fascinating.  Will you join me, starving wolf?

###8000058
Your hunger may beget a fine shinobi. A worthy right hand.

###8000059
On that day...

###8000060
a young cub was taken from the battlefield.

###8000061
He trained relentlessly and indeed--

###8000062
went on to become a master shinobi.

###8000063
Listen Wolf, you must never forget the Shinobi Code.

###8000064
As your father, my word is absolute.  Your master's is a close second.

###8000065
As of today, he is your master.

###8000066
Defend him with your life.  If he is taken, bring him back at any cost.

###8000067
You understand me, don't you Wolf...

###8000068
Is the war... finally over?

###8000069###23002000###23002002###23002305###23002406###24001000
Lord Isshin...

###8000070
Enemy general, Shuzen Tamura, is slain by my hand!

###9900001
Loyal Wolf.  Take my blood, and live again.

###10000030
You... Need something?

###10000900
What do you call yourself?

###10000902
Your eyes...

###10000903
The eyes of a wolf who has failed in his duties... Or so it seems to me.

###10000904
... That is not your concern.

###10000905
Spoken like a true shinobi.

###10000906###10001001
I must carve the Buddha.

###10000907###10001002
You do what you will.

###10001000
You again?

###10001100
No matter what I do, any Buddha I carve is an incarnation of wrath. 

###10001101
Thus is the fate of those who owe a deep karmic debt.

###10001102
You'll understand when you try carving one for yourself one day.

###10001103###10001602
So... Need something?

###10001300
I've found one...

###10001301
A shinobi tool?

###10001303
I said before that your prosthetic arm was a fang...

###10001304
But by fitting shinobi tools to your arm
you'll be able to change the form of that fang.

###10001305
Thick shields? Break them into splinters...
Swift foes? Bring them down from afar.

###10001306
Fitting more devices means more ways to slay your enemies.

###10001307
If there's someone that needs killing, there's a proper way to kill them...

###10001308
That's all there is to it.

###10001309
... Seems you know this prosthetic very well.

###10001310
I should calm myself.

###10001311
The more I speak of bloodshed, the more demonic my sculptures will become.

###10001312
Give it here. I'll fit that tool for you.

###10001400###10001500
I can... hear the ring-ring of a bell chime.

###10001401###10001501
You mean... this old bell?

###10001402
An old woman asked me to offer it to Buddha.

###10001403###10001502
That bell... Have you seen it before?

###10001404###10001503
No... It is unfamilliar.

###10001405###10001504
It appears the bell disagrees.

###10001406###10001505
I think it's trying to tell you something.

###10001407###10001506###12100006###22001421###24000005###26011205###29200001
What...?

###10001408###10001507
Give it as an offering.

###10001409###10001508
The kind-faced Buddha near the wall
is different from the Buddhas I make.

###10001410###10001509
It was carved by the hand of the true Sculptor...

###10001600
I've gone and said much too much.

###10001601
Anyway, do what you will.
Offer the bell to Buddha, or don't.

###10001700
... So you're back.

###10001701
Was that... a dream...?

###10001702
Or was it real?

###10001703
Hmm...
Whether it was a dream or it was reality... I have no idea.

###10001704
There is one thing I can tell you...

###10001705
The Great Buddha has seen fit to awaken old memories within you.

###10001706
What you felt, what you remembered...

###10001707
That is what it all depends upon.

###10001708
I’m not sure if what I saw is what truly happened...

###10001709
That's how it works.

###10001800###11105200
It appears...

###10001801
As though your old memories have been awakened.

###10001803
I saw... the Divine Heir.

###10001805
I won't say any more, and neither should you.

###10001806
All that you saw was yours alone.

###10001900###10070901###10071200###10080401
Sculptor...

###10001901
What did that Buddha show you?

###10001902
Were you listening?

###10001903
...Tell me.

###10001904
Flames.

###10001905
Flames...?

###10001906
That is all I can see. It doesn't matter what offering I make.

###10001907
Flames... spreading as far as the eye can see and consuming Ashina...

###10001908###10080003###11110903###22011001###22011101###24010409###24011402###24011502
That's...

###10001909
We're done here.

###10002000###11110941###22031101
I understand.

###10002001###22010606
Good.

###10002100
Ohhh... I see you've acquired something quite interesting.

###10002101
A mechanical barrel.

###10002102
It's a mechanism that can serve as the very core of the prosthetic.

###10002103
Hand it here. I'll fit it to the arm for you.

###10002104
What difference does the barrel make?

###10002105
With a versatile base such as this...

###10002106
I can use various purifying agents to further hone that fang of yours.

###10002107
Purifying agents?

###10002108
Purifying agents are materials that can be used together with the barrel... things like gunpowder and scrap metal.

###10002109
So if you find something of that sort, be sure to bring it my way.

###10002200
Oh, you're here? Need something?

###10002201
The Divine Heir...

###10002202
Huh?

###10002203
You saved him.

###10002204
That has nothing to do with me.

###10002205
It does... You have my thanks.

###10002206###23111203
...... 

###10002207
The shadow in your eyes... it's become a shade lighter.

###10002208###10002401###10011818###10020701###13010304###13010406###22001811###22003610###23001466###23110203###23111824###26010408###26010705###26010907
What?

###10002209
No matter... So, you need something?

###10002300
I brought tea.

###10002301
Did you now?

###10002302
Quite the busybody, aren't you.

###10002400###36000200
Listen...

###10002402
You'll be the one to kill me.

###10002403
... What are you talking about?

###10002404
Don't play the fool.

###10002405
To make her have to kill me... I don't think I could bear it.

###10002406###70010005
Please...

###10002501
A true wolf...

###10002502
Would choose for himself how to use his fangs.

###10002503
... The look on your face tells me you've done just that.

###10002700
You have a slightly different air about you now.

###10002701
It's as though... you've overcome something.

###10002800
What's that you have there...

###10002801
Where did you get that finger?

###10002802
The Guardian Ape of the Sunken Valley... I found it in his belly.

###10002803###10011206###11103804###11120803###23002855###23111302###26010709###26011209###38000003
... I see.

###10002804
... To think it was in the belly of an Ape...

###10002805
Let me see it.

###10002806
I'll fix it to your prosthetic arm.

###10003000
You see the kind-faced Buddha there...? That isn't one of mine.

###10003001
It was carved by the true Sculptor.

###10003002
When a man must confront what is inside of him... it can probably be of help.

###10003003
...confront what is inside him...?

###10003004
Anger... Sadness... Or perhaps old memories of times long gone...

###10003005
That kind of thing.

###10003101###10090109###11102814###11103603###11111803###13001001###17020406###17020806###22004101###22011926###23001202###23100501###23100601###23100604###23101404###23110201###26001201###38000102
What is it?

###10003102
... Seems to me your battle sense has returned.

###10003103
You’re more like a shinobi than before, if only a little.

###10003104
... Take this.

###10003105###10003203###23002121
What is it...?

###10003106
Shinobi techniques...

###10003107
Recorded within are fighting techniques that cannot be performed by samurai.

###10003109
Whether you make use of them or not is up to you.

###10003110
Shinobi aren't the only ones with their own fighting techniques...

###10003200
The Shinobi prosthetic...

###10003201
Appears you've taken to it quite well.

###10003202
Here, this is for you.

###10003204
It contains ways to...

###10003205
Bite into your foes with that fang of yours...

###10003206
In other words, fighting techniques for your prosthetic arm.

###10003207###31010301
...I see.

###10003208
I had thought that prosthetic techniques wouldn't ever be needed again...

###10003209
... But it seems I was wrong.

###10003300###10080200###10080400###10080500###10090000###70050101
(Cough, cough...)

###10003301
You're... here too...?

###10003302
It's so... busy here today...

###10003401
Sculptor?

###10003402
... What? Need something?

###10003500
Wait...

###10003501
You should not offer that bell just yet...

###10003502
You must walk the path to regaining your memory in the proper order.

###10003601
This temple has too many visitors lately.

###10003700
I see you're here, too...

###10003701
I'm busy carving my Buddha.

###10010000
If you want to train with that blade of yours,
head to the right when you leave this ramshackle temple.

###10010001
You're sure to find an ideal sparring partner.

###10010400
A shinobi is only as strong as the number of tricks up his sleeve.

###10010401
If you find any more "Devices," be sure to bring them here.

###10010500
If you find any other Prosthesis Upgrade Materials,
bring them to me.

###10010600
You've got something quite special there.

###10010601
With this, you'll be able to alter the Prosthesis,
and get even more out of those Tools.

###10010602
If there's a Prosthesis Tool you want to upgrade, just give it here.

###10010700
Some time has passed since I lifted you from that field, but--

###10010701
Our Lord Prince is still alive.

###10010702
They'll soon make use of His blood.

###10010703
"Returning dead."

###10010704
From the looks of you, I'd say it's something worth seeking out.

###10010800
That's a "Shinobi Prosthesis."

###10010801
Years ago, when I lost my left arm--

###10010802
it was handed down to me by a certain someone.

###10010803
Still, no use to a Buddhist sculptor. You can have it.

###10010900
The prosthesis doesn't just compensate for your lost arm.

###10010901
Bring me any "Devices" you happen to find.

###10010902
Then you'll learn to appreciate its worth.

###10011000
I don't know the details, but--

###10011001
they say one seldom appears in Ashina
who bears the power of Immortality.

###10011002
I fear your Master is the one of which they speak.

###10011003
What rotten luck, eh? Seems your death won't come easily.

###10011200
Why am I here?

###10011201
... All I did was drag you here.

###10011202
Didn't even know if I was dragging a corpse.

###10011203
Couldn't let you get eaten by a pack of wild dogs.

###10011204
How long was I asleep?

###10011205
Some time has passed since I found you.

###10011207###11102210###11103305###22011306###22030705###23000650###23010050###23102320###24010202###24010301###24100008
However...

###10011209
.........!

###10011210###10011302
He's being held prisoner in Ashina castle.

###10011211###10011303
They will soon make use of his bloodline.

###10011212###10011304
Looking at you, I'm sure you appreciate the value it has.

###10011300
Some time has passed since I found you...

###10011400
My left arm... What did you do to me?

###10011401###10011500
That is what I call the Shinobi Prosthetic.  

###10011402###10011501
A fitting fang for a one-armed wolf.   

###10011403
Useless when it comes to carving Buddha though. You can have it.

###10011404
Shinobi Prosthetic...

###10011405
It is no mere replacement for your lost arm.

###10011406###10011502
Come to me if you find any shinobi tools.  

###10011407
Shinobi tools? I see.  For this device...

###10011408
You catch on quick.

###10011409
If you bring me shinobi tools, I'll find a way to fit them to the Shinobi Prosthetic.

###10011410###10011504
Then you'll come to appreciate its worth.

###10011412
I've said too much...

###10011413
Go now.

###10011503
I'll fit it to the Shinobi Prosthetic.

###10011600
What did you mean when you said they'll make use of his bloodline?

###10011601
I don't know much about him. Except...

###10011602###10011700
The Dragon's Heritage.

###10011603###10011701
There's a special kind of blood by that name.

###10011604###10011702
And that blood runs through your master's veins.

###10011605
So the Divine Heir...

###10011606
Someone's after him.

###10011607###10011704
Might be that the strange things happening to your body
have something to do with that.

###10011703
Which is why someone's after him.

###10011800
I brought some tea.

###10011801
(Sniffs)

###10011802
This "tea" smells pretty good.  Suppose I'll have some.

###10011803
Oh, I needed that..

###10011804
This tea reminds me of Emma's father.

###10011805
About Lady Emma's father...

###10011806
Dogen...

###10011807
He was an extraordinary doctor.

###10011808
He was also very well-versed in mechanisms and devices.

###10011809
... Better put, he was obsessed with mechanisms to the point that it affected his health...

###10011810
He didn't take much else seriously, but I owed him my life...

###10011811
Ah, and we could say that you owe him your life as well.

###10011812###23000652###23010052###24010204
What do you mean?

###10011813
When I lost my left arm, Dogen created that thing...

###10011814
which has now become your left arm.

###10011815
The first version was a complete failure, didn't work at all.

###10011816
So he remade it. Then he remade it again, and again, countless times.

###10011817
(chuckles)

###10011819
He told me I needed to practice with the prosthetic in order to use it properly...

###10011820
So Emma would pester me into carving her spinning tops and other toys.

###10011821
After much... training... of that sort, it came to be called a Shinobi Fang.

###10011822
In other words, that prosthetic arm... is Dogen's legacy.

###10011823
His legacy...

###10011824
Ahh... so much time has passed.

###10011826
While I have abandoned my shinobi ways...

###10011827
That alone, I could not bear to abandon.

###10011895
Dougen?

###10011896
So you know of him.

###10011900
I brought some sake.

###10011901
Don't mind if I do.

###10011902###11000010###11111515###12030100###13000100###21000200###23110210###23110303###24000608###29010204###30010006###60003000###60003006###60003105
Hmm...

###10011904
Is it not to your liking?

###10011905
... No, it's damn good.

###10011906###15060000
Ahhh!

###10011907
But it does make my old wounds ache.

###10011908
Your left arm?

###10011909
Yes.  And this sake was a favorite...

###10011910
of the man who cut it off.

###10011911
Who was...?

###10011912
Lord Isshin.

###10011913
... Isshin?  Why?

###10011915
He... did it for my sake.

###10011916
Ahhh.

###10011917
I was on the verge of being consumed...

###10011918
Consumed by what?

###10011919
... Shura.

###10011921
Well, whether you believe me or not, that's for you to decide.

###10011922
But you'd do well to beware...

###10011923
Shura's shadow.

###10012000
I brought something for you.

###10012001
... Monkey Booze, is it?

###10012002
Haaa!  It burns the throat, same as ever.

###10012003
This really brings back memories.

###10012004
Did you drink this often?

###10012005
I trained in the techniques of the shinobi

###10012006
in the valley where the monkeys dwelled...

###10012007
... By yourself?

###10012008
... No. There were two of us.

###10012009
We were rogue shinobi...

###10012010
There was no proper master for the likes of us.

###10012011
That's why we went to the valley.
To run, to jump, to clash swords... where one slip would mean your doom.

###10012012
That was how we trained.

###10012013
... We came to move exactly as monkeys did after a time.

###10012014
I'd drink this Monkey Booze whenever I tired of training.

###10012015
And I’d listen to the howl of my partner’s whistling finger while I drank.

###10012016
Howl...?

###10012017
It was from her unique ring...

###10012018
Whistling through that ring...

###10012019
Would fill the valley with a somber melody.

###10012020
Strangely enough, I enjoyed that sound.

###10012021
I listened to it so often.

###10012100###23111700###23111800###24010400
I brought sake.

###10012101
Hooh.... Dragonspring...? That's fine quality sake.

###10012102
I'll take it then.

###10012103
Now that really hits the spot...

###10012104
There's nothing quite like this.

###10012105
I often drank this with Dogen...

###10012106
Emma would keep our cups filled.

###10012107
Have you known Lady Emma for long?

###10012108
That was a long time ago...

###10012109
I found her on a battlefield.

###10012110
... a battlefield.

###10012111
She crept up slowly towards me, her eyes fixed, unwavering on the rice I held in my hand.

###10012112
It became too much to bear, so I gave it to her.

###10012113
Then she just started following me.

###10012114
After that...

###10012116
Well a while later...

###10012117
Ashina became a dangerous place for the both of us.

###10012118
Around then Dogen adopted her as his daughter.

###10012120
I suppose it didn't really matter where she ended up.

###10012121
One thing's for sure, she's happier for the fact she wasn't raised by a shinobi.

###10012200
Idols are all I can carve.

###10012201
The only Buddhas the wood shows me have...

###10012202
faces of wrath.

###10012203
And I can only carve what I see.

###10012300
I've abandoned the path of the Shinobi.

###10012301
Yet I couldn't abandon that Shinobi Prosthetic
no matter how hard I tried.

###10012302
I'd never have believed that one such as myself would save another who'd lost their arm like you have...

###10012303
I'm sure it is fate.

###10012500
Ahh.. I'm parched.

###10012501
Could use a cup of tea...

###10012600
I've held onto this charm of yours.

###10012601
At the request of that meddling young woman. 

###10012602
I take it, your master entrusted you with this.

###10012603
Why don't you take it with you again?

###10012604
The path before you may be filled with suffering...
It's your choice. Do what you will.

###10012700
Yes, I'll take it.

###10012701
Yes, that's a good choice.

###10012702
If you wish for further hardship...

###10012703
You can choose to bear that burden the next opportunity that comes by.

###10012801
No, huh?

###10012802
Well, that's your choice. Do what you will.

###10020000
You off?
Alright then. Don't go falling in any pits, now.

###10020100
You're quite the strange one, yet...

###10020101
Other peculiar visitors have come to this temple.

###10020102
There's one in the clearing to the right of the gate leading off the temple grounds.

###10020103
Two strangers in strange circumstances...

###10020104
You two might get along.

###10020200
Yes, right... that kind-faced Buddha you see over there...?

###10020201
Don't do anything funny with it.

###10020300
With the mechanical barrel... so many possibliites...

###10020400
If you want more forms for that fang of yours...

###10020401
You'll need to search for more Shinobi tools.

###10020402
There's no turning back from this path now.

###10020403
The least I can do is load your arm.

###10020500
... Listen.

###10020501
That finger whistle I've fixed onto your arm...

###10020502
I'm sure it'll play a somber... but enjoyable tune.

###10020503
Make sure you use it well.

###10020600###24020101
Another time, then.

###10020601
I'll lend you shelter any time.

###10020700
......... Say...

###10020702
Did you know?

###10020703
This temple is horribly drafty.

###10020704
........ Sure it is.

###10020800
... Hey.

###10020801
Don't be afraid to go all out.

###10050000###10050100###10050200###10050300###10050400###10050500###10050600###10050700###10050800###10050900
I see you found yourself a "Device."

###10050001
A "Shuriken Wheel," is it?

###10050002###10050102###10050202###10050302###10050402###10050502###10050602###10050702###10050802
Well, give it here. Let's fix it to that arm of yours.

###10050101
A "Heat Exhaust," is it?

###10050201
A "Black Iron Hatchet," is it?

###10050301
"Shinobi Gunpowder," is it?

###10050401
"Raven Feathers," is it?

###10050501
A "Poison Kodachi," is it?

###10050601
A "Shinobi Steel Plate," is it?

###10050701
A "Seal Bead," is it?

###10050801
A "Shinobi Lance," is it?

###10050901
... ... ... 

###10050902
You... 
Where did you get this?

###10050904
... Ah. From the belly of the Yasha Ape.

###10050905
Well, give it here.
Let's fix it to that arm of yours.

###10060000
That's a "Loaded Shuriken" Upgrade. Give it here.

###10060100
That's another "Loaded Shuriken" Upgrade. Give it here.

###10060200
That's a "Gunpowder Flash" Upgrade. Give it here.

###10060300
That's another "Gunpowder Flash" Upgrade. Give it here.

###10060400
That's a "Flame Vent" Upgrade. Give it here.

###10060500
That's another "Flame Vent" Upgrade. Give it here.

###10060600
That's a "Helm Breaker" Upgrade. Give it here.

###10060700
That's another "Helm Breaker" Upgrade. Give it here.

###10060800
That's a "Raven's Mist" Upgrade. Give it here.

###10060900
That's a "Loaded Dagger" Upgrade. Give it here.

###10061000
That's another "Loaded Dagger" Upgrade. Give it here.

###10061100
That's a "Steel-ribbed Fan" Upgrade. Give it here.

###10061200
That's a "Divine Abduction" Upgrade. Give it here.

###10061300
That's a "Loaded Spear" Upgrade. Give it here.

###10061400
That's another "Loaded Spear" Upgrade. Give it here.

###10061500
That's a "Finger Whistle" Upgrade. Give it here.

###10070000
Wolf... I'm... sorry...

###10070100
Fare...well... Wolf...

###10070200
Now... I can... die...

###10070300
You... mustn't... fail...

###10070700###10071100###12160800###15030000###15030300###16030000###16030100###16030300###16030400###16130000###17030800###17030900###17031400###17031500###17031600###18030100###21000006###24260100###24260600###24260700###27030000###27030100###27030500###28030000###28030100###28030400###29030100###30030000###30030100###30030600###31030800###32030000###32030100###33160700###33160701###33160800###35030200###35060200###36030400###36030500###36030600###36030700###36130000###36130100###36130400###36130500###36130600###36130700###41030000###41030100###41030200###41030400###42030000###42030100###42030200###42030400###43030100###43030200###43030400###44030000###44030100###44030200###44030400###45030000###45030100###45030200###45030400###46030400###47030400###50030200
   

###10070800
So these are the flames of hatred...

###10070900
Finish me... please...

###10071000
Farewell, Sculptor...

###10071001
Wolf... Thank... you...

###10080000
What exactly... happened to me...?

###10080001###10080100
The Stagnation of the Dragon's Heritage... I can see it overflowing.

###10080002
I don’t understand.

###10080004###24000513
(coughing)

###10080005
What's wrong...?!

###10080006
Dragonrot.

###10080007
The Stagnation overflows and spreads...

###10080008
A disease that leads eventually to death...

###10080009
...what... are you talking about?

###10080010
You don't need to worry about me.

###10080011###10080403
I'm... not normal, you see.

###10080012
It's difficult for me... to speak now.

###10080013###10080101
Ask Emma... about the rest...

###10080201###23010706
... What is it?

###10080300
......... (Wheeze...)

###10080402
I don't need your concern.

###10080404
No mere Dragonrot... will kill me.

###10080501
I've brought medicine for the Dragonrot.

###10080502
Lady Emma made it.

###10080503
Emma did it...? So she did...

###10080505
........ (cough...)

###10080506
Any change?

###10080507
Well... Breathing's a bit... easier now.

###10080600
...Well? Need something else?

###10080601
......... Sculptor.

###10080602
You said you're "not normal."

###10080603
What does that mean?

###10080605###10080701
The only thing I do at this desolate, ruined temple...
is carve wrathful Buddha idols.

###10080606###10080702
These are not the actions of one who is right in the head.

###10080801
Are you better now?

###10080802
That's Emma for you...

###10080803
She's always been the type to finish what she starts.

###10080805
One more thing...

###10080806
......... Thanks.

###10090001
Yes... That should be enough.

###10090002
Thank you, Orangutan.

###10090003
Emma.

###10090004
What are you going to do... with the coughed-up blood of an old bastard...?

###10090005
I'm going to research the Dragonrot.

###10090006
I want to find the cure for it.

###10090007
Orangutan... I'm doing this for your sake, too.

###10090008
... You are, are you?

###10090009
I don't need your meddling. I'll get over it on my own...

###10090010###23000702###23001460
......... Hmm.

###10090011
Now then... Let me take a look...

###10090012
Dragonrot infected blood...

###10090013
How exactly... Is this illness caused...?

###10090014
......... Hah.  Dougen...

###10090015
Emma is just like you.

###10090100
Orangutan... The Central Forces are here.

###10090101
... Are they now?

###10090102
They never change their thieving ways...

###10090103
Are the flames... still burning?

###10090104###10090200
Emma...

###10090105
The answer to that isn't going to change.

###10090106
I could carve Buddha idols for all eternity and the flames of hatred would still rage on.

###10090107
The most I can do is keep them in check.

###10090108
......... Orangutan.

###10090110
If the time ever comes, then I'll...

###10090112
I have Buddha to carve... Good-bye...

###10090201
Does that sit well with you?

###10090202
I can't honestly say.

###10090203
To achieve their goal of Immortal severance...

###10090204
Either he, or Lord Kuro...

###10090205
Must die.

###10090207
Why does that have to be the only way...?

###10090208
So... will you keep that from them?

###10090209
But, Orangutan...

###10090210
If I give this to him... he's going to die.

###10090300###24001002
... Emma.

###10090301
Should you have let him go like that?

###10090302
... He would've gone anyway.

###10090303
I couldn't have stopped him.

###10090304
You're probably right.

###10090305
... Say, Orangutan.

###10090306
I'd like to at least hold on to hope.

###10090307
The hope that he can accomplish it.

###10090308
Yes, you should.

###11000000
Loyal Wolf.

###11000001
I have one more thing to give you.

###11000002
It's a gourd of medicinal waters.

###11000003
Should you be injured, it will restore you.

###11000004###11104011###11104202###11111280###11120702
My Lord.

###11000005
Now then...

###11000006
Were you gravely injured... afterward?

###11000007
After what?

###11000008
... Do you not remember that night?

###11000009
I do not.

###11000011
... No, we'll talk about it later.

###11000012
Right now, we must escape Ashina Castle.

###11000013###11102810
As you say.

###11000014
There's a secret passage beneath the moat bridge that will take us out of the castle.

###11000015
Lord Isshin told me about it once.

###11000016
I ask you to find that secret passage.

###11000017
Once you find it, hmm...

###11000018
Signal me with a reed whistle.

###11000019
You know, like you used to, long ago.

###11000020
I will join you as soon as I hear it.

###11000022
Loyal Wolf...

###11000023
I see you are wounded.

###11000024
...I have something that may help.

###11000025
It is a special gourd of medicinal waters.

###11000026
Use it to heal your wounds.

###11000031
Hm? Wolf, do you have something for me?

###11000100
There's a secret passage beneath the moat bridge that can take us out of the castle.

###11000101
Find the secret passage
beneath the moat bridge so that we may escape Ashina Castle.

###11000102
When you've reached it, give the signal.

###11000103
I'll come as soon as I hear the reed whistle.

###11000200
Where shall we go once we're away from the castle?

###11000201
I suppose the first thing we should do is cross the Ashina border...

###11000202
Or perhaps we should hide somewhere...

###11000203
What do you think?

###11000204
Whatever you desire.

###11000205
Whatever I desire?
That's the Wolf I know...

###11000206
My lord?

###11000207
... Oh, nothing.  I was just reminiscing...

###11000208
Onward, then.

###11000300
Let us press onward.

###11000301
Once we leave this passage, we'll be outside the castle walls.

###11000500###11102204###11160004###33065402
... Wolf.

###11000501
Do not push yourself too far.

###11000502
You must heal your wounds.

###11010000###31010300###40010100
No...

###11010001
I see. I leave this in your hands then, Wolf.

###11010100
This is for you, My Lord.

###11010101
It's from that time...

###11010102
So you noticed, then.

###11010103
I'd like to ask that you keep this for me, my lord.

###11010104
But this charm has protected you all this time.
It's held your suffering at bay.

###11010105
I do not wish for you to suffer any more than you already have...

###11010106
That is why I ask you to keep it in your possession.

###11010200
Suffering is what I desire.

###11010201
So please, allow me to return it to you.

###11010202
I understand... Thank you...

###11010203
The path before you will now be fraught with
more hardships than ever before.

###11010204
But knowing you, you'll overcome them.

###11010205
I believe in you, brave Wolf.

###11010301
I will keep it for a while longer.

###11010302
Yes, please do so.

###11010303
Knowing that you possess it is a comfort.

###11040000
Wolf.

###11040001
I do have one more thing to give you.

###11040002
Take it.

###11050000
Wolf, you said to me once--

###11050001
"Do what must be done."

###11050002
But I have yet to discover what it is that I must do.

###11050003
I don't understand.

###11050004
Why was I granted this power...?

###11100000
Well done... 

###11100001
I am grateful that you came here.

###11100002###11100202###11100302
It is my duty.

###11100003
Hehe... Still the same as always.
You could try smiling once in a while, you know.

###11100004
Your Highness, we should go.
We must leave Ashina at once.

###11100005
No...we must not.

###11100006
I cannot leave Ashina.

###11100007
My blood - the immortal curse.

###11100008
As long as the curse endures,
running away will change nothing.

###11100009
I... I wish to sever the ties of the immortal curse.

###11100010
I wish to break these chains that bind people in madness.

###11100011
Will you help me?

###11100012
I must protect you, Your Highness.
It is the rule imposed upon me by my stepfather.

###11100013
The only way you can truly protect me
is by putting a stop to the immortal curse.

###11100014
Only then will my blood no longer be saught by men.
Only then will you be relieved of your duty.

###11100015
But Your Highness... 

###11100016
This immortal... 

###11100100
According to ancient Ashina folklore... 

###11100101
Sacred Treasures have been discovered along the
stream of Rejuvenating Waters that flows through Ashina.

###11100102
It is said that collecting these Sacred Treasures
will reveal the key to severing the curse.

###11100200
It appears you found the Fountainhead Village's Sacred Treasure.

###11100201
I am glad you came back.

###11100203
Hehe... Is that all you can say?
A bit more feeling would go a long way.

###11100300
So you found the Bodhissatva Valley's Sacred Treasure.

###11100301
I am glad that you are safe.
Sorry for putting you through all this.

###11100303
... ... You know,
I really do not mind a little less formality.

###11100400
The Fountainhead Village and the Bodhissatva Valley.
You have done well to find both Sacred Treasures.

###11100401
But these alone will not be enough to sever the curse.

###11100402
Please, go to Hachiyouji Temple
and uncover its secrets of immortality.

###11100500
Now we have the two Sacred Treasures and Immortal Edge.

###11100501
The last Sacred Treasure... Where could it be?

###11100502
The Hachiyouji Temple Page was supposed to be searching for it.
How about you pay her a visit?

###11100600
The Hachiyouji Temple Page may know something
about the last Sacred Treasure's whereabouts.

###11100601
How about you pay her a visit?

###11102000###11250100
We managed to drive them back once.

###11102001###11250101
But the Interior Ministry's army is far too powerful.

###11102002###11250102
And that is why...

###11102003###11250103
You wish to use the power of my blood?

###11102004###11250104
It doesn’t matter how much power you obtain.
You’ll keep on fighting until you’re a monster, incapable of feeling pain or fear...

###11102005###11250105
I... do not wish to corrupt the lives of men...

###11102006###11250106
Look at this mountain of bodies.

###11102007###11250107
Ashina cannot be defended by normal means.  Not anymore.

###11102008###11250108###23000304
...!

###11102009###11250109
I could... never be as strong as you, Lord Genichiro.

###11102010###11250110
I do not yet know... what it is I should do...

###11102100###11250111
... it's been a long time since... that happened.

###11102101###11250112
Wait all you like, it will do you no good.

###11102200
I have come for you, my lord.

###11102201
... Yes. You did well to come here.

###11102202
Let us go.

###11102203
We must leave Ashina.

###11102205
My blood...
the blood of the dragon causes men to become undying.

###11102206
The same goes for you.

###11102207###11104705
... Yes, my lord.

###11102208
I wished to save you.

###11102209
I'm sure that I would do
the same thing given another chance.

###11102211
Undying begets stagnation.

###11102212
The Immortal Oath, the Rejuvenating Waters, the Dragonrot.

###11102213
They all corrupt men to the point that they no longer live as men.

###11102214
I wish to sever the chains of stagnation bred by the Dragon's Heritage.

###11102215
Wolf, will you help me achieve this aim?

###11102300
If we are seeking to sever the immortal ties, I know a good place to start.

###11102301
Wolf, look at this.

###11102302
It's an ancient record that was kept in Ashina Castle.

###11102303
Sacred Dragon Tears... from the divine realm...

###11102304
Yes. It is my belief that with the Dragon Tears...
It may be possible to sever the Dragon's Heritage.

###11102305
But... The divine realm? How do we...

###11102306
I know...

###11102307
Wolf. That incense burner over there.

###11102308
It belonged to a... person of interest.  Take a look.

###11102400
Is there something special about it...?

###11102401
I'm told that long ago...

###11102402
There was another Divine Heir living here in Ashina Castle.

###11102403
His name was Lord Takeru...

###11102404
This incense burner belonged to him.

###11102405
Where is he now...?

###11102406
He died a long time ago, apparently.

###11102407
"Wrapped in the aroma of the fountainhead, I return to the divine realm."

###11102408
Those are supposedly the words he left behind.

###11102409
You’re saying that the scent of the fountainhead...
Is the key to reaching the divine realm.

###11102410
That is my belief.

###11102411
Wolf, let us discover the truth together.

###11102500
Now, as to how we begin our search...

###11102501
I am certain some of Lord Takeru's books remain in this castle.

###11102502
Books that he collected in order to find the divine realm.

###11102503
I will search for them.

###11102504
In addition to finding a way to reach the divine realm...

###11102505
Might we also look into how we might sever the immortal ties?

###11102506
A fine suggestion.  Talk to Isshin.

###11102507
If anyone knows the answer, it is him.

###11102508
Wolf, come with me.

###11102600
Lord Isshin is not within this castle citadel.  I'm told he is recuperating in one of these watchtowers.

###11102601
However, the path to his watchtower is closed.

###11102602
His health is a little...

###11102603
How do I get in?

###11102604
On the roof, there's a path patrolled by the Nightjar ninja.

###11102605
It's intended for shinobi, but I imagine that won't be a problem for you.

###11102606
I've heard the Nightjar use smoke signals as landmarks.

###11102607
Yes.  So If you follow their smoke signals,
you should be able to reach Lord Isshin.

###11102608
And you can use this window to reach the roof.

###11102690
You can use the window I showed you to reach the roof.

###11102691
You can use that window over there to reach the roof.

###11102700
Find Lord Isshin...
and ask if he knows how we might sever the ties of immortality.

###11102701
He's recuperating in one of the watchtowers outside this castle keep.

###11102702
Reach the roof from that open window,
then follow the Nightjar smoke signals.

###11102703
I entrust this task to you.

###11102800
(cough) Hmm... This dust is awful.

###11102801
I have returned.

###11102802
Oh, Wolf. You're back?

###11102803
Did you meet with Lord Isshin?

###11102804###11104903###11111510###23000916
I did.

###11102805
He said, "The Mortal Blade...

###11102806
...it could be the key to severing immortality."

###11102807###24000300###24010004###24010100
The Mortal Blade...

###11102808
It's a sword that has the power to kill the undying.  It can be found at Senpou Temple.

###11102809
I see... Yes, that seems promising.

###11102811
For my part... 
I hunted for any books that may contain clues about the aroma of the fountainhead.

###11102812
It seems Lord Takeru indeed sought a way to reach the divine realm.

###11102813
So far I've found one piece of relevant information.

###11102815
A flower.

###11102900
I must ascertain the secret to the aroma of the fountainhead
so that we may reach the divine realm.

###11102901
I will tell you what I've found so far.

###11103000
I see you've gathered some of the ingredients needed to create the aroma of the fountainhead.

###11103001
Keep up the good work, Wolf.

###11103100
Wolf, look here.

###11103101
I've found something that may help us.

###11103102
It's a stone.

###11103103
A stone?

###11103104
Yes.  Look at this.

###11103105###11104203###23002303###23002404
What is...?

###11103106
It is a writing by one who sought the fountainhead aroma.

###11103107
It says there's a sacred village with a stone that gives off a unique scent.

###11103108
But I haven't heard of such a village.

###11103109
Hmm... It says here that it is beneath Ashina...

###11103110
Beyond the bottom of the well you awoke in, near the Moon-view tower...

###11103111
it says there is a bottomless hole.

###11103112
It may be relevant to our search.

###11103113###11111210###22002605
I will take a look.

###11103114###11111211
Good. The text did say to "throw oneself"... I wonder what that could mean...

###11103200
My Lord, the incense burner...

###11103201
You smelled it? What did you think?

###11103300
I asked Lady Emma about the sakura tree.

###11103301
You did? What did she say?

###11103302
The tree is called an "Everblossom." Lord Takeru brought it here from the divine realm--

###11103303
But it has withered away and no longer remains.

###11103304###11104716###11250005###14200025###14200505###23000903###23000919###23001350###23002309###23002410###24000808###24011104###26010603###26011101###30130000
I see...

###11103306
It is said that someone plucked a branch from the Everblossom and stole off with it.

###11103307###11111703
Hmm... Who would do such a thing?

###11103309###11111705
... What's lost is lost.

###11103310###11111706
Finding a stolen tree branch?  We have no information to go on.

###11103311###11111707
Let us gather what we can for the aroma first.

###11103312###11104603###11104805###11111708
As you wish.

###11103400
My Lord, I've procured the flower for the fountainhead aroma.

###11103401
Oh? Was it truly blooming in the sunken valley?

###11103402
Yes, deep within the valley.

###11103403
So that is where the fountainhead waters pooled deeply.

###11103404
You've done well to acquire this, Wolf.

###11103500
My Lord, I have procured the ingredients for the aroma.

###11103501
Oh, so that is... the stone for the Fountainhead Incense?

###11103502
What a peculiar shape it is.

###11103503
The stone looks to be an object of worship.

###11103504
Oh...? It was worshipped? Interesting custom.

###11103505
Yes. There was also an inscription--

###11103506###11104724
"A sweetly scented bridal offering."

###11103507
...written on the altar.

###11103508
Bridal...? Hmm.

###11103509
What sort of place was this?

###11103510
It was in a cave, beyond a door made of solid rock.

###11103511
Hmm... In that case, where was the wedding procession headed?

###11103512
No way to know, I guess...

###11103513
Sweetly scented...

###11103514###23010701###23111908
Hmm?

###11103515
Lord Kuro...
That place might be the gateway to the divine realm.

###11103516###22002607###23111812
......... I see.

###11103517
Sweetly scented... meaning wrapped in the Fountainhead Incense...

###11103518
That is what it might be referring to.

###11103590
Yes, it had been made into some sort of shrine.

###11103591
So it was just as Lord Takeru wrote.

###11103595
Yes, the book described it perfectly...

###11103600
Oh, and actually...

###11103601###23001401
I've found something.

###11103602
I discovered there's another scent we must acquire.

###11103604###11111804
The blood of the Divine Heir of the Dragon's Heritage... In other words, my blood.

###11103605###11111805
Your blood...

###11103606###11111806
But my lord... you cannot bleed.

###11103607###11111807
Yes, it is true that those of the Dragon's Heritage cannot bleed.

###11103608###11111808
However, in Lord Genichiro's quarters, I found a curious journal belonging to Lord Takeru's page.

###11103609###11111809
And it appears there is a way for me to bleed.

###11103610###11111810
For now, I'd like to ask you to keep this for me.

###11103611###11111811
Now then... We just need to figure out how to make me bleed...

###11103612###11111812
Perhaps we should ask Lady Emma?

###11103613###11111813
Hmm... As a doctor she should have much knowledge of the human body...

###11103614###11111814
Yes, she may be able to help us.

###11103700
To think my blood is an ingredient of the aroma...

###11103701###11111902
Perhaps Lady Emma will know of a way to make me bleed.

###11103702###11111903
Might you ask her?

###11103800
Wolf, did you speak with Lady Emma?

###11103801
......... I did.

###11103802
And?  What did she say?

###11103803
That it could be possible with the Mortal Blade.

###11103805
So the Mortal Blade will allow my blood to flow.

###11103806###11103812###11103832###11104729###11110610
... As you wish.

###11103810###24010300
I've heard the Mortal Blade is in Senpou Temple.

###11103811
Will you obtain it for me?

###11103820
Hmm... Shall we give it a try?

###11103821
The Mortal Blade was never meant to be drawn.

###11103822
There is no knowing how it will affect you.

###11103823
Burning the incense may help protect you from such harm.

###11103824
Yes... If you insist, then that is what we shall do.

###11103830
This should be all of the necessary ingredients for the aroma.

###11103831
Wolf, burn the incense.

###11103900
Wolf, that sword on your back, is it...

###11103901
It is the Mortal Blade.

###11103902
The sword that can kill those who cannot die...

###11103904
It was given to me by the Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters at Senpou Temple.

###11103905
The Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters?

###11103906
The monks at Senpou Temple abandoned the ways of their faith
in pursuit of immortality.

###11103907
The result is those who have false Dragon's Heritage...

###11103908
Known as the Divine Children of the Rejuvenating Waters. 

###11103909
A false Dragon's Heritage... I never would have thought...

###11103910
Wait--  Divine... Children?

###11103912
Many were created, but only one survived.

###11103913
Further proof of the corruption this power brings to man...

###11103914###11103922
The ties of immortality must be severed.

###11103920
With the Mortal Blade in hand, I can now be made to bleed.

###11103921
We are one step closer to creating the Fountainhead Incense.

###11104000
Wolf, you're back.

###11104001
I am.
I have something for you, Lord Kuro

###11104002
Something for me?

###11104003###23001402###23112000###24001102###24010500###24011300
Here.

###11104004
This... It's rice...?

###11104005
Yes, the Divine Child of Senpou Temple told me to give this to you.

###11104006
She did? Then I am grateful.

###11104007
This looks like good rice... (Low laugh.) Each grain glistens.

###11104008
It is sweet when you bite into it.

###11104009
Bite...?

###11104010
Wolf... Rice tastes a lot better when cooked.

###11104012
Hmm... So do you like sweet things?

###11104013
I will eat anything.

###11104014
Which means you don't dislike sweets, then.

###11104015
Right, I'll make something nice for you.

###11104016###11104101
Something... nice?

###11104017
You'll have to wait and see.

###11104100
I'll make something nice for you with the rice you gave me.

###11104102
You'll just have to wait and see.

###11104200
Sorry to keep you waiting, Wolf.

###11104201
Come now, hold out your hand!

###11104204
Sweet sticky-rice balls.

###11104205
I made them with the rice from the Divine Child.

###11104206###11104301
Eat it, don't be shy.

###11104300
It's a sweet sticky rice ball made from the rice you gave me.

###11104400
How was the rice ball?

###11104401
It was delicious.

###11104402
I bet it was.

###11104403
Ever since I was little, I've enjoyed making sweets.

###11104404
I used to always sneak into the kitchen back at the Hirata estate.

###11104405
Maybe one day... I'll open up a tea house if I ever have the time.

###11104501
I am relieved to see that you are safe.

###11104502
And Owl...?

###11104503
I killed him.

###11104504###23111401
(Gasp)

###11104505
......... I am sorry.

###11104506###22002115
Lord Kuro.

###11104507
I am sorry...

###11104508
I did what had to be done.

###11104510###17021100
Thank you...

###11104511
My father...

###11104512
This was in his possession.

###11104513
This branch... it's from the Everblossom tree...?!

###11104514
I see... So Owl had it...

###11104515###11104801###12000010###22003409###23010208###23010408###23010741###24000507###24010422###24011505###40010000###60003604
Yes...

###11104516
So we can now complete the Fountainhead Incense.

###11104517###11104521
Yes... Yes...

###11104518
Our goal is within reach, Wolf.

###11104520
We are a step closer to the Fountainhead Incense.

###11104522
That's right, Wolf...

###11104530
Everblossom...

###11104531
Lady Emma spoke of it once.

###11104532
The Everblossom is a sakura tree that was brought over from the divine realm by Lord Takeru.

###11104533
It once bloomed behind this castle.

###11104534
However, when a branch was cut off and the flowers taken...

###11104535
The Everblossom eventually dried and withered away.

###11104536
So this is that branch?

###11104537
Yes, I believe so.

###11104600
Wolf... We've finally done it.

###11104601
Once we make the Fountainhead Incense, you can infuse your clothes with the aroma.

###11104602
Now, place all of the ingredients in the incense burner.

###11104701
Wolf, the Mortal Blade...

###11104703
... Fear not. I will only make a shallow cut.

###11104704
Would you draw the Mortal Blade from its sheath?

###11104706
... Forgive me, but...

###11104708
...... Yes, my lord...

###11104709
(gasp)

###11104711
...how is the wound?

###11104712
I'm fine. I just made a small cut on my chest.

###11104714
So this... is the Fountainhead Incense.

###11104715
It's so... extraordinarily nostalgic...

###11104717
Well? Do you notice anything different...?

###11104718
The aroma... and...

###11104719###11104721
Fountainhead Palace...

###11104720
Those words have been burned into my mind.

###11104722
It is just as Lord Takeru wrote...
That place must lead to the divine realm.

###11104723
But how can the Fountainhead Palace be reached...

###11104725
That was written on the altar where the fragrant stone was placed.

###11104726
Yes. You now carry the aroma of the Fountainhead Incense.

###11104727
I believe the path leading to the Fountainhead Palace will open before you if you go to the shrine within the cave.

###11104728
Immortality shall soon be severed... I'm counting on you, Wolf...

###11104800
Wolf, I need you to bring Dragon Tears from the divine realm...

###11104802
You must first go to the depths of the cave where you found the fragrant stone.

###11104803
You now carry the scent of the Fountainhead Incense

###11104804
I believe the path leading to the Fountainhead Palace will open before you if you enter the shrine within the cave.

###11104901
You've done well to return to me, Wolf...

###11104902
Did you reach the Fountainhead Palace?

###11104904
Good. I was worried.

###11104905
Dragon Tears...

###11104906
I will obtain them and return.

###11104907
Yes, I'm counting on you... Wolf.

###11105001###11150000
(sleeping)

###11105101
... I hope he's all right.

###11105102
... Hmm?

###11105103
Oh, Wolf.  Are you unhurt?

###11105110
Ah, this is for you.

###11105111
It fluttered in through the window.

###11105112
I expect those two are just as
concerned for your well-being as I am.

###11105201
The Interior Ministry’s army is beginning to stir.

###11105202
... But there's no need to worry, Wolf.

###11105203
Lord Isshin comes to check on me now and then.

###11105204
His visits give heart.

###11105300
I've just remembered, Wolf.

###11105301
During my research I found some things that may be of use.

###11105302
Use them as you see fit.

###11105310
There are some things lying around that may be of use to you.

###11105320
I've found some things that may be of use. 

###11105400
Oh, that's right...

###11105401
That door marked with the outline of a person...

###11105402
Lord Isshin once called it a "shinobi shortcut."

###11105403
I haven't a clue how it works...

###11105404
But seeing as he mentioned "shinobi" I thought you might know.

###11110000###22010000
The Sacred Treasures follow the Rejuvenating Waters.

###11110001###22010001
One is enshrined in the Fountainhead Village.

###11110002
Another is enshrined in the Bodhissatva Valley.

###11110003###22010003
And one more was taken somewhere, far away.

###11110004###22010004
Find the Sacred Treasures, and the path that opens
will reveal the key to severing the curse.

###11110100
Bodhissatva Valley runs along the back of
Ashina Castle, beyond the Great White's shrine.

###11110101
The citizens of the valley worship a Serpent Deity... 

###11110102
But they don't answer to the Ashina household,
and they don't take kindly to tresspassers.

###11110103
Even you should be careful out there.

###11110200
The Fountainhead Village can be found at the lowest point of Ashina.

###11110201
There is a great gorge into where immortals
are cast away into the underworld.

###11110202
They say that is the only way to reach the village.

###11110300###11120400
Ah yes, my grandfather, Isshin Ashina
may possess some knowledge of the curse.

###11110301###11110400###11120401
You can find him resting in his quarters.

###11110302###11110401###11120402
The room is heavily guarded from the front,
but you should be able to reach it from the rooftops.

###11110500###12000000###12000019###12030003###12100000###12100009
Father...

###11110501
(I cannot break the Iron Code.)

###11110600###26011100
I cannot.

###11110601
To protect you, the Divine Heir...

###11110602
That was the duty my father entrusted to me.

###11110603
How many times have you
died and come back to life for my sake...?

###11110604
Two? Three times...?

###11110605
Or perhaps a number so large that it cannot be counted?

###11110606
As it was for the purpose of defending my Lord, the number does not matter.

###11110607
I do not wish to bind you...

###11110608
 to an eternity of undeath.

###11110609
Wolf... Join me in my quest to sever the ties of immortality.

###11110611
Thank you, Loyal Wolf.

###11110700
My Lord, please take a look at this.

###11110701
That bell... I've seen it before.

###11110702###11110801
It reminds me of Hirata... and of that night...

###11110704
Forgive me, Wolf.

###11110705
You brought it all this way to me...
but I don't have need for it anymore.

###11110706###11110802
I've heard there's a run-down temple on the outskirts of Ashina where one can offer items with a significant past to Buddha...

###11110707###11110803
Lady Emma also frequents that temple.

###11110708###11110804
Wolf, would you take that bell and make an offering of it there?

###11110710###11110806
I will make the offering.

###11110800
... I've seen that bell before.

###11110900
My Lord, this is for you...

###11110901
Could this be...?

###11110902
It's a sakura droplet.

###11110904
When the Undying Pledge of the Dragon's Heritage is broken...

###11110905
It's said that this remains in place of the oath.

###11110906
Do you think this one was left behind by Lord Takeru?

###11110907
... That seems likely.

###11110908
Wolf, if you so desire...

###11110909
I can use this sakura droplet to assist you.

###11110920
If you should be so kind...

###11110921###22002616###22011304###23111911
Of course.

###11110931
That was a boon granted by Lord Takeru.

###11110932
Use it well.

###11110940
My lord's oath is all I need.

###11110942
But don't refuse it to spare my feelings.

###11110943
If you feel it is necessary, do not hesitate to ask.

###11111000
A flower?

###11111001
First, read this.

###11111002
What is...

###11111003
Lord Takeru left it behind.

###11111004
I was looking for information on the fountainhead aroma, and how it relates to the divine realm.

###11111005
There is water that flows from the fountainhead through Ashina...

###11111006
And the book speaks of a white lotus flower that
grows where that water pools deeply.

###11111007
It appears to be one component of the fountainhead aroma.

###11111008
A place where the fountainhead waters pool deeply...

###11111009
Perhaps in a deep valley?

###11111010
Yes.. Indeed, the sunken valley may be the place.

###11111011
The fountainhead waters should flow into there.

###11111012
Where is this sunken valley?

###11111013
It's beyond the woods to the rear of the castle.

###11111014###11111104
There's a shrine dedicated to the White Serpent deep in the woods.

###11111015###11111105
As the name implies, the sunken valley is just below that place.

###11111016###11111106
There's no proper path down there,
but a man of your talent could navigate it.

###11111020
Hmm? What is it, Wolf?

###11111030
That's... the white lotus flower...!

###11111031
Was it in the Sunken Valley?

###11111040
I see, so that valley is indeed where the Fountainhead waters pool deeply.

###11111041
I didn't expect you to find it so quickly.

###11111042
Well done, Wolf.

###11111060###11111200
My Lord, this is for you.

###11111070
Yes, deep within the Sunken Valley.

###11111100
One part of the fountainhead aroma...

###11111101
Is a white flower that blooms where the fountainhead waters run deep.

###11111102
Yes, my lord. I will search the sunken valley.

###11111103
The sunken valley is beyond the woods to the rear of the castle.

###11111201###12000005###22004105###24100204
This is...

###11111202
A document written by one who sought the fountainhead aroma.

###11111204
it says there's a "fragrant stone" in some sacred village...

###11111205
But I've never heard of such a village.

###11111206
It is beneath Ashina.

###11111207
... Now that you mention it... about the well near the Moon-view Tower...

###11111208
I've read it may have some connection with a bottomless hole.

###11111209
This may be worth investigating.

###11111220
I do not know.

###11111221
Hmm... I don't know either...

###11111222
See if you can think of a place.

###11111230
A place to throw oneself...

###11111231
I've seen a place where that might be possible...

###11111232
You have...?

###11111233
There is a great, seemingly bottomless hole in the abandoned dungeon outside Ashina castle.

###11111234
An old woman there...

###11111235
She told me to throw myself in.

###11111236
... Hmm. This hole --
you believe it's connected to somewhere?

###11111238
I felt a faint wind blowing in from the
direction of the torii gate.

###11111239
I think I will try jumping into it.

###11111240
... It's worth a try.  But do be careful.

###11111250###11111517
What is it, Wolf?

###11111251
Hmm? What is that strangely shaped rock you hold...?

###11111252
Is that... the fragrant stone of the fountainhead?

###11111260
Yes, it is just as the book described.

###11111281
This stone appeared to have been enshrined...

###11111300
A fragrant stone, a sacred village,
all beneath Ashina...

###11111301
The text says that beyond the bottom of the well you awoke in, near the Moon-view tower...

###11111302
There is a bottomless hole.

###11111303
Perhaps through that hole, you'll find whatever is beneath Ashina...

###11111304
But what did the text mean by "throw oneself"...?

###11111400
It says there's a fragrant stone and a sacred village, all beneath Ashina...

###11111401
I imagine you will reach that place
if you leap from the edge.

###11111402
I felt a faint wind blowing from the
direction of the torii gate.

###11111403
I will make the leap.

###11111404
... All right.  But please, be careful.

###11111500
I did not.

###11111501
I see. Then I suggest you do so at some point.

###11111502
It is faint, yet...
it makes you feel as though there is still some of the aroma left.

###11111511
The smell... was reminiscent of sawdust..

###11111512
But also, it smelled faintly of sakura flowers...

###11111513
Oh? So you smelled it too?

###11111514
I felt the scent was much like sakura flowers, but slightly different...

###11111518
That scent... it reminds me of something.

###11111519
You've smelled it before?

###11111520
I believe so... but I can't remember where.

###11111521
Now that you mention it...

###11111522
Lady Emma said that once long ago there was a sakura tree to the rear of the castle.

###11111523
Perhaps that is relevant to our search?

###11111600
The scent in the incense burner reminded me of a sakura tree.

###11111601
Yet it wasn't a regular sakura flower.

###11111602
Lady Emma might know something about the sakura tree
that was once in the back of the castle.

###11111700
So the Everblossom has withered and no longer remains...

###11111701
That is correct.

###11111702
But it is said that someone plucked a branch
from the Everblossom and stole off with it. 

###11111800###11111900
I must remain vigilant...

###11111801
Wolf... I've made progress.

###11111802
I'm sure this is the last ingredient for the aroma.

###11111901
Wolf... All that's left is to find a way to make me bleed.

###11112000
... My Lord.

###11112001###30010003
Wha?!

###11112002
O-Oh it's just you, Wolf... I'm sorry, I was asleep.

###11112101###11112102###11112103###11112104
(Kuro is sleeping)

###11112105
Nnnnng....

###11112106
... Hm? Oh it's you, Wolf.

###11112107
(yawns)

###11112108
You could have woken me up, you know?

###11112109
Certainly not.

###11120000###11120100###11120200###11120300
I suppose you should go.

###11120001###11120101###11120201###11120301
My faith rests in you, shinobi.

###11120600
Ahh, I meant to ask.

###11120601
Did you notice the lingering scent in the incense burner?

###11120700
You're leaving.

###11120701
Wolf, I'm counting on you.

###11120800
I've just remembered, Wolf...

###11120801
Lady Emma said she'd visit the grave of Lord Takeru.

###11120802
There was something she had to confirm, apparently.

###11120804
Lord Takeru's grave should be to the rear of the castle.

###11140000
Thank you, Wolf.

###11140001
The bolt was too heavy for me to move.

###11140002
Think nothing of it.

###11140100
This is... very good...

###11140101
That it is, that it is.

###11140200
Too shy to eat it in front of me?

###11140201
Well, that's fine too!

###11140300
(sneezing)

###11140301
Still so much dust.

###11140302
How long have these books been here?

###11150002
I wish... a better way.... (murmurs)

###11150100
......... Hmm... 

###11150101
(sneeze)

###11150102
Hmm... It's so dusty...

###11150103
My nose won't stop itching. It's unbearable.

###11150200
Mm... Mmhm... 

###11150201
Hard to make them much better than this.

###11150202
Well done, Kuro.

###11150300
When did you...

###11150301
lose your path...

###11150400
......... He's...

###11150401
...so strong...

###11150402
... I wish... I was....

###11150500
We're almost there.

###11150501
......... Yes...

###11150502
Do... What must be done.

###11150520
(...My lord.)

###11150530
(What...must be done...?)

###11160000
...It is time, Lady Emma.

###11160001
Yes, I know.
Master Genichiro is waiting, is he not?

###11160002###11160010
I will return to the top of Ashina Castle.

###11160005
That reed whistle we used before.

###11160006
This time, I will use it...

###11160007
to call on you.

###11160020###11250002###23110510
Lord Kuro...

###11160100
The smoke rising above the rooftops...

###11160101
They're signals used by the Nightjar shinobi.

###11160102
If Wolf is coming, I'm sure he could follow their path...

###11160110
I'm sure Wolf could use those signals to reach the top of the castle...

###11250000
This man... was from Hirata.

###11250001
I must pay my respects.

###11250003
Lady Emma, are there other Hirata survivors?

###11250004
There... are very few of us left.

###11250006
... Apologies.

###11250007
There's no end to those who seek the Dragon's Heritage...

###11250008
This was their fate... because of those that pursued me.  I didn't mean to involve them...

###11250200
Lady Emma, tell me... what has caused the state of this man?

###11250201
The Rejuvenating Waters.

###11250202
That is what it is called.

###11250203
Are you telling me that this is Ashina's secret weapon...?

###11250204
I am.

###11250205
Those who drink it cannot fully die...
No, they become unable to die at all.

###11250206
The Rejuvenating Water, it also...

###11250207
It springs from the Dragon's Blood, does it not?

###11250209
Lady Emma...
I do not believe the Dragon's Blood is sacred.  Not at all.

###12000001
...It's you...

###12000002
I'm afraid I...made a bit of a blunder.
Perhaps...the years have finally caught up with me... Ugh!

###12000003
Don't bother tending to my wounds...
No point... it's too late...

###12000004
Wolf... you must... take this...

###12000006
The key to the secret temple...in the Estate mansion.

###12000007
You'll find him... the Divine... Heir.

###12000008
Going through the front is not an option... you'd never get past the fire.

###12000009
Yes sir.  Perhaps the cliffs just outside of here...

###12000011
Return to the estate entrance, and look for a side route along the cliffs.  Take the back entrance through the cemetary.

###12000012
That's your way in.

###12000014
Wolf, never forget the Iron Code.

###12000016
The master is absolute...!

###12000017
Wolf... protect your master... with... your life...

###12000018###18900006
(coughs)

###12030000
That day...

###12030001
I pulled you from the battlefield, a starving cub...

###12030002
I had no idea what you'd become.

###12030004
It breaks my heart...

###12030005
but I'm putting you down!

###12030101
The shinobi prosthetic... this was once...

###12030102
Curious device you have there...

###12030200
What a fine specimen you've become, Wolf.

###12030201
Allow me to honor your efforts--

###12030202
and show you this old Owl's true power!

###12030300
I told you, didn't I?

###12030301
The parent is absolute.

###12030302
Disobedience will not be forgiven.

###12030400
Farewell...

###12030401
Defeated by my own son?

###12030402
The feeling is not entirely unpleasant...

###12030500
Good riddance... starving wolf.

###12030501
That day on the battlefield...

###12030502
Perhaps I should have left you to die...

###12030601
Head to my left and follow the cliff...

###12030602
If I go through the cemetary there will be a path to the inner estate...

###12030603
Leave it to me, father.

###12030700
The fire's too strong... need to find another way through.

###12100001
To think you were...still alive...

###12100002
That was my design.

###12100003
But the same can be said for you -- 
I was certain you died that night.

###12100004
The power of the Divine Heir brought me back.

###12100005
That's it!

###12100007
The Divine Heir's power...

###12100008
the Dragon's blood must be mine.

###12100010###12100600
Remember the first rule of the code.  As your father, I order you to forsake your master.

###12100011###12106001
From this moment, he is your master no more.

###12100012###12116803
Listen to me, Wolf...

###12100013###12122204
Obey your father's command, and forsake the Divine Heir.

###12100014###12111402
Forsake... The Divine Heir?

###12100015
...Now you see it.

###12100200
...As you command.

###12100201
In accordance with your father's word, you will forsake the Divine Heir...
You understand now, don't you?

###12100300
...I cannot do as you ask.

###12100301
You... what?
A shinobi... showing the likes of... compassion?

###12100302
Unthinkable... such a miserable display.

###12100303###14100600
Ugh...

###12100304
...No, I cannot.

###12100305
... No. I cannot.  I will not.

###12100306
... No.  I will not.

###12100400
Now, you will help me retrieve him, that impudent child.

###12100401
You understand, don't you?  The Iron Code's first rule.

###12100402
A parent's will is absolute...
To disobey a parent is unforgivable.

###12100403
That's right, my boy.
You haven't forgotten who your father is, have you?

###12100500###12130700
... Yes. The code is absolute.

###12100501###12130701
I hereby forsake my master... the Divine Heir.

###12130000
...Enough talk!

###12130001
Been a while since we did this.

###12130002
Give me your all!

###12130100
...it warms my heart, Wolf.

###12130101
To see how you've grown!

###12130200
One...!

###12130201
The parent is absolute.
Their will must be obeyed!

###12130202
...yet I'm sensing some insubordination.

###12130300
Two...!

###12130301
The master is absolute.
You give your life to keep him safe. You bring him back at any cost.

###12130302
...At this rate, you'll lose him again.

###12130400
Three...!

###12130401
Fear is absolute.
There is no shame in losing one battle.  But you must take revenge by any means necessary!

###12130402
...I wonder if you've got it in you - to bring me down.

###12130500
No more than a stray dog after all.

###12130501
An exercise in futility... 

###12130600
...Farewell

###12130601
Such a shame, my boy.

###12130602
I didn't get to show you--

###12130603
the Owl's true strength... 

###12160000
WAIT... wait, please!

###12160100
My son!  A moment!

###12160200
You fool!

###12160300
Gullible as ever!

###12160400
Now you're mine!

###12160500
Have at it, boy.

###12160600
This saddens me...

###12160700
The "Returning Owl."

###12160701
I learned it from you...

###12160702###12161200
That's... my boy...

###12160900
Very well!

###12161000
Death of a shadow...

###12161100
You taught me well.

###12161300
W-Wait!

###12161400
Never let down your guard!

###13000000
Hmm? ...Never seen you before.

###13000001
Your name?

###13000003
Hmph.  Won't tell me?

###13000004
... but you do have the look of a skilled shinobi.

###13000005
A shinobi... Or perhaps...

###13000006###13010902###36110100###36110200###40000002###40000006###40000201###47010100###47010300###47110100###70070001###70102100
...

###13000007
...Sir.

###13000008
Please, heed my humble request...

###13000009
Face me in battle.

###13000101
Damn, still alive.

###13000200
That swordsmanship...

###13000201
it was a thing to behold.

###13000202
Few have managed to kill me in such a thorough manner.

###13000203
What are you?

###13000204
Some call it "undying"...

###13000205
Others "infested".

###13000206
I can't die, so I just... am.

###13000207
How about you?  What brings you to a run-down temple like this?

###13000209
.........Hmph.

###13000210
Seems you have a lot on your mind.

###13000211
Say...

###13000212
Why don't you use me for some sword practice?

###13000213
...might come in handy for whatever your mission is.

###13000214
A warm body that can't die might prove useful to you.  I volunteer mine.

###13000215
Well?

###13000300
Oh, it's you.

###13000301
Had a change of heart?

###13000302
Care to use me for some sword practice?

###13000400
About our training...
I think it's about time we tried something closer to a real fight, don't you?

###13000401
Come at me with the intent to kill.

###13000402
No better way to prepare for the real thing.

###13000404###13030600###22001803###22003605###22011506###22011606###22012006###23001461###23100507###23111814###23112105###30210003###31001604
What's wrong?

###13000405
Why do you go to such lengths...?

###13000406
Half to pass the time...

###13000407
And the other half... well...

###13000408
...I want to loosen that furrowed brow of yours.

###13000409
All right, enough talk. Let's begin.

###13000600
Oh, it’s you.

###13000601
You may use me to hone your swordsmanship, if you like.

###13000700
Now, let's begin.

###13000800
Once again, a satisfying match.

###13000801
Being killed for a worthy purpose was a bit... refreshing.

###13000802
One little thing, mind going a little easier on me?

###13000803
This actually hurts quite a bit.

###13001000
That sword on your back...

###13001100
I can finally die.

###13001101
My shame for not following my master into death... can finally...

###13001102
You're certain of this?

###13001103
Yes... I want you to kill me.

###13001104
...As you wish.

###13001105
Go on, do it!

###13001201
.........Farewell.

###13001300###13010907
I will prepare for the beyond. The next time you see me, I'll be ready.

###13001400
Have you noticed...

###13001401###13001500
This temple attracts those with nowhere else to go.

###13001402###13001501
...I certainly fit that description.

###13001404###13001502
And I suppose that's why...

###13001405
Interesting things make their way into the offering box from time to time.

###13001503
Interesting things make their way into the offering box from time to time. 

###13010000
In that case, I stand as your opponent.

###13010100###24110000
Very well.

###13010101
Right then, let's go.

###13010102
They say swinging one's sword is a cure for boredom.

###13010200###13011002###17010802###17011100###17021003###23010300###23110207###24110100
No.

###13010201
Is that so?  Well, I can't force you.

###13010202
I thought it might help to pass the time.

###13010203
Let me know if you have a change of heart.

###13010300
I'm sorry.

###13010301
Hahaha, I'm kidding!
Don't hold back for a minute.  Slice and stab away!

###13010302###17020401###22001814###22004103###22004203###22010610###22031001###23100503###26011000###32010013
All right.

###13010303
Hehe...

###13010305###13010407
I'm just glad that my curse is of use to someone.

###13010306
Feels as if there could be a purpose to it after all.

###13010400
You have my gratitude.

###13010401
Huh? What do you mean?

###13010402
I am truly grateful to you for enduring such pain for me.

###13010403
Haha, no need to thank me.
I know what I said before, but actually I'm used to the pain.

###13010405
Heheh...

###13010408
Maybe it's not pointless after all.

###13010500
Feel like talking about that sword on your back now?

###13010501
The truth of it.

###13010600
So...

###13010601
Have you decided to end my curse?

###13010701
What...?! It's real...?!

###13010702
...You don't suppose...

###13010703
You could use it to end this curse of mine?

###13010800
This...?

###13010801
It's a... just a sword.

###13010802
(Hmm...) Truly?

###13010803
There's nothing special about it.

###13010804
.........if you say so.

###13010805
Should you ever discover that it's more than that... you can tell me.

###13010900
I will... of course.

###13010901
...Thank you.

###13010903
A man with your skill could grant a merciful death. 

###13010904
Couldn't you?

###13010905
...Leave it to me.

###13010906
Splendid.  I must give my thanks to Sekijo.

###13011000
.........No.

###13011001###15010006###22010608
But...

###13011003
...I...see.

###13011004
I can't force you to do it.

###13011005
But please, I beg of you...

###13011006
Think it over, will you? I'll be here if you change your mind.

###13020000
Come back whenever you like.

###13020001
If you have techniques to try out, I’m at your disposal.

###13030000
Excellent... I expected no less of you.

###13030100
A satisfying match.

###13030200
Yes, splendidly done.

###13030300
Again!

###13030400
One more time.  

###13030500
Face me again. 

###13030700###23112003
Something wrong?

###13030800
Attack me.

Come now...

###13050001
Trying to cut me down...

###13050002
is a waste of energy.

###14000000
Oi, guvnor! You there!

###14000001
Mister shinobi, sir!

###14000002
I got this shop over 'ere!

###14000003
Stop by for a spell, eh?

###14000004
Cheap as chaff, just for you!

###14100000
Guvnor!
Oh guvnor, I reckon a steel fan would suit you right.

###14100001
With this, you'd have neither bow nor pelter to fear.

###14100002
Why, even cannon fire would
ba-ba-BANG right off yer noggin'!

###14100003
I tell thee.

###14100100
Guvnor! Welcome, welcome!

###14100101
Now now, please, buy the whole lot.
Buy the whole bleedin' shelf.

###14100200
... Told those morons to give it a rest.

###14100201
But they don't, they just keep sending more.  Such a pain in my...

###14100202
Huh? You one of them nightjar cronies?

###14100203
... No.

###14100204
Course not. There's something different about you.

###14100205
But I'd say you're in the same line of work.

###14100206
The name's Blackhat Badger. What's yours?

###14100208
Heh, real sociable one, aren't we?

###14100209
First this stubborn lot, now a down-in-the-dumps shinobi... 

###14100210
And then those Ashina boys raising hell outside.

###14100211
Could this day get any better?

###14100212
...You're a fugitive?

###14100213
Something like that, sure.

###14100214
By the by, I'm a little out of pocket these days... 

###14100215
Got the goods, but no one to sell 'em to.

###14100216
Been waiting for someone like you to show up.

###14100300
Heheh... This here dive ain't half bad.

###14100301
Got clientele coming in left and right.

###14100302
All are welcome! ... Well, as long as they got the cash.

###14100400
Ohh, well look who it is.

###14100401
Need something?

###14100500
In other words, I'm closing up shop.

###14100601
Badger...

###14100602
Look who it is...

###14100603
... I couldn't take it. Too many rats.

###14100604
Swarming in out of the woodwork... 

###14100605
Isshin must've terrified 'em.

###14100606
That's why... I gone and done something a little out of character.

###14100607###23002001###70001000
What happened?

###14100608
Those mangy rats...
They were closing in on a little kid... 

###14100609
Heh... So... 

###14100610
So I saved him.. Now look at me.

###14100611
Guess the great Blackhat Badger's story ends here...

###14100613
(Heheh)

###14100614
I gotta thank ya...

###14100615
Take what you want...when I'm gone... 

###14100616
Heheh... I would give it to ya now...but...but....

###14110000
By the way, guv,
did you spot any of them scoundrels with the wooden cone hats?

###14110001
Persistent buggers, they are!

###14110002
I'd much sooner fill me pockets with gold
than fill buckets with blood, ya know?

###14110003
So I left the sorry lot.

###14110004
Tell you what guv, if you had a hefty axe,
you could split them wooden hats in two... 

###14110005
If you spot any, give 'em a good stickin', would ya? For me?

###14110100
Now, if you ask me... 

###14110101
This iron-ribbed fan has your name written all over it.

###14110102
With this, you won't pay arrows or bullets no heed. 

###14110103
Never know, it might even hold against cannon fire.

###14110200
Heheh. You hear about this one?

###14110201
Rats've been swarming into Ashina Castle these days.

###14110202
You know the ones I mean...

###14110203
But there's this hell-bent old-timer, cutting 'em up like it was nothing.

###14110210
I hadn't heard.

###14110211
Is that right...?

###14110212
At the big castle gates where that Gyoubu demon fella was... 

###14110213
There's a watchtower, on the side near serpent valley.

###14110214
You should find the old bastard there.

###14110215
You're well informed.

###14110216
That's 'cause I take a keen interest in saving my own skin.

###14110217
That old geezer... 

###14110218
Got a feeling he don't discriminate between badgers and rodents.

###14110220
Was he wearing a Tengu mask?

###14110221
Ahh, so you did see him.

###14110222
Yes. We spoke.

###14110223
Heheh... Well, ain't you just full of surprises.

###14110224
I'm impressed he let you keep your head.

###14120000
Off home are we, guvnor?
Drop in any time!

###14120100
Off home are we, guvnor?

###14120101
Highly recommend the steel fan, guv.
Do drop by if you change yer mind.

###14120200
Oh yes! Only the finest for you, guvnor!
The deep black steel matches your steely gaze!

###14120201
Ahh, I do love it when everyone walks away happy!
Come again! Come again!

###14120300
Well, I'll be here.  Raking in the profits.

###14120301
Come back any time you like.

###14120500
Well, that's that... 

###14120501
Thanks to your patronage, I'm a wealthy man.

###14120502
Enough to make arrangements, at least.

###14120503
Thinking I may be leaving soon.

###14120504
Where to?

###14120505
Senpou Temple up on Mt. Kongo.

###14120506
There's all sorts of rats 'round here these days.

###14120507
Got a feeling things are gonna get real ugly real soon.

###14120508
So it's about time I tied up some loose ends.

###14120600
I got some business to take care of at Senpo Temple.

###14120601
Take care of yourself, ya hear?

###14160000
Whoa!

###14160100
Gyaa!

###14160200
Damn you!

###14160300
That stings, you moron!

###14160400
Well, well... 

###14160401
If that's how it's gonna be...!

###14160500
No different from the rest... 

###14160501
You cause trouble, you see where it gets ya.

###14160600
Ughhhhh...

###14160601
You...piece of... 

###14200000
Huh? So you made it out this way, too.

###14200001
You?

###14200002
Heheh, like I said. Loose ends.

###14200010
Huh? You're a shinobi, right?

###14200012
... Can't answer that one, eh?

###14200013
Still, I'd wager we're in the same line of work.

###14200014
They call me Blackhat Badger.

###14200015
I got a spot over at Ashina castle, but...

###14200016
I'm here on some business.

###14200017
What brings you to the temple?

###14200019
Oh ho, the strong, silent type, huh.

###14200020
What are you doing here?

###14200021
Over there...
I need to cross to the other side of the cliff, but I'm fresh out of ideas.

###14200022
There's no way to cross?

###14200023
If you had a shinobi kite, that'd do it.

###14200024
But it ain't easy keeping the kite afloat.
Especially when you're an amateur with cargo to spare.

###14200026
There's an assassin below the cliff who handles the kites.

###14200027###14200102
If he could keep that thing in the air... It'd be risky but it just might work.

###14200028
Thing is, he won't take a bribe.
I ask ya, what's the world coming to?

###14200100
You see over there...?
I'm tryin to figure a way to get to the other side...

###14200101
There's this little tyke below the cliff who flies the kites.

###14200200
Heheh. The Puppeteer Technique, huh?

###14200201
First time I've seen it.

###14200202
Not bad... not bad at all.

###14200204
Heh. Thought I'd finally see you crack a smile.

###14200205
And with that, I can attend to my personal matters.

###14200206
Thanks, pal.

###14200300
Heheh... That Puppeteer Technique of yours really is something.

###14200301
Now I can use the kite to get across the ravine.

###14200302
Appreciate it.

###14200400
Huh...? What're you doing?

###14200401
Just when the kite was finally up and flying...

###14200500
Well, well, if it isn't old chuckles.

###14200501
Did you take care of your business?

###14200502
That I did, all thanks to you.

###14200503
Whose grave is this...?

###14200504
This? It's ah... It belongs to my kid.

###14200506
After the little runt passed away... 

###14200507
All the grunt work I used to do just didn't cut it.

###14200508
Experiments with rejuvenation, kidnapping, the responsibilities of a Blackhat... 

###14200509
Everything to do with this temple was just rubbing me the wrong way.

###14200510
So that's why you quit?

###14200511
... That's right.

###14200512
Anyway... That about wraps things up here for me.

###14200513
Guess I've got nothing else to do but head back to Ashina castle.

###14200514
Be a damn sight better than this place.

###14200600
Well... That takes care of my business here. I owe you one.

###14200601
Guess it's about time I headed back to Ashina Castle.

###14200602
Oh, by the way.

###14200603
You probably figured already, but... 

###14200604
Ashina, you know...
She reeks of charred corpses and gunpowder something fierce.

###14200605
The rats are flooding in like you wouldn't believe.

###14200607
You watch yourself out there.

###14210001
Give me strength...
I just wanna get this business seen to... 

###14210100
An old lady was saying,

###14210101
"Wind the puppet, fly a kite"

###14210102
... One of those old crones?

###14210103
You can't take what they say lightly.

###14210104
In fact... 

###14210105
There could be some shinobi technique.
Making others do your dirty work. Mind control, y'know?

###14210106
Maybe that's what she was talking about.

###14900000###16900000###17900400###18900300###26900800###27900200###29900400###30900400###31900600

(wheezing and coughing up blood)

###14901000
(Wheeze... Wheeze...) Look who it is.

###14901010###26900001###26900201###26900401###27900001###31900001###31900101
You're ill...

###14901020
Dragonrot...?

###14901030
(Wheeze... Wheeze...)

###14901031
(Heheh.) Damn... Things have taken a bad turn...

###14901100###18910000###18910100###27910000
Drink...

###14901101###16910004###17910007###17910105###30910001###41900101###42900101###43900101###45900101###46900101###47900101
(Gulps)

###14901102###29910005
(Sigh of relief...)

###14901103
You should feel better soon.

###14901104###18900002###27900100###27900102###29900003###29900100###29900103###31900100###31900200###31900300###31910207###41900300###42900300###43900300###44900300###45900300###46900300###47900004###47900300
(wheezing)

###14901105
Heheh... The great Blackhat Badger wasn't quite himself for a while there.

###14901106
Sorry to have troubled ya.

###14901201###26900100###26900200###26900300###26900400###26910101###30900000###30900100###30900700

I'm taking a blood sample.

###14901301###16900801###17910301###18900801###26910301###27900601###29900701###30910201###31900901

... Now to bring this to Lady Emma.

###14901400
Well, if it isn't my favourite customer.

###14901401
I appreciate what you did for me before.

###14901402
That rot put me out for a spell... 

###14901403
But thanks to you, I couldn't be better.

###15000000
Urrhh... Nngh...

###15000001###30000000###30200000###30200202
Ahhh... Ahhh...

###15000100###15010301
(Crying)

###15010000###26010400
Why are you crying?

###15010001
Because... I'm sad...

###15010002
What are you sad about?

###15010003
I don't know where Lord Sakuza is. Or what he's doing.

###15010004
It breaks my heart.

###15010005
If I can't see him, I'd at least like to know...

###15010007
No matter how many letters I send, he never writes me back.

###15010008
And no one will tell me where he is.

###15010009
Actually, sir...

###15010010
Can you tell me? Where is Lord Sakuza?

###15010100
I don't know.

###15010101
Ohh... You're a liar, too...

###15010102###15010202
Why must everyone hide him from me?

###15010201
Ohh... so you won't tell me either...

###15030001###15060001###15060301
Ohh... You, too...

###15030002###15060002###15060302
How dare you hide Lord Sakuza from me!

###15030100###15060100
Ohh, Lord Sakuza...

###15030101###15060101
If you won't come to me

###15030102###15060102
At least, instead...

###15030200###15060200
Ohhh... I'm so glad.

###15030201###15060201
Lord Sakuza...brought me that man in his stead...

###15030202###15060202
Oh, and he's right over there...

###15030301
Why would you hide him from me?!

###15060300
You pretend not to see me...?

###15060400
Uwaaah!

###16000000
Oh... is that you, Inosuke?

###16000001
My son, have you seen the young master?

###16000100
I am not your son.

###16000101
There you go again, Inosuke.

###16000102
You always tease that I'm getting senile,
but a mother knows her own son!

###16000103###16000203
...Hmm, well anyway...

###16000104
Take this bell.

###16000105###16000205
It's a charm I made with the young master in mind.

###16000106
Please, offer it to Buddha for his sake.

###16000201
What, nothing to say?

###16000202
Does your stomach hurt or something?
You always had a weak stomach.

###16000204
Go on, take this bell.

###16000206
Please, offer it to Buddha in his memory.

###16000300
Inosuke, my son.

###16000301
Have you offered the bell charm to Buddha?

###16000302
Have you tried the run-down temple with that stubborn sculptor in it?

###16000303
I'm sure you'll find Buddha there.

###16000305
Oh, my son... You really are a sweet boy.

###16030001
My son... What have...

###16030200
S-stop...!

###16030301
Son... what have you...

###16030401
I knew it... like father... like son...

###16100000
The son of Owl...

###16100001
I saw... a dreadful vision...

###16100002
It was pouring out!

###16100003
More, and more...
It wouldn't stop! Wouldn't stop...!

###16100004
The young master... The young master is deep in the mansion...

###16100005
My son...
Inosuke went to rescue him, so he's probably fine, but...

###16100006
But you never know.  The young master might need you, rogue shinobi.  Go to him, will you?

###16100100
Horrible, dreadful!  It won't stop pouring out...

###16100101
Th-The young master is deep within the mansion.

###16100102
Rogue shinobi, please go save the young master!

###16130001
I knew it... Like father, like son...

###16900301###17900001###29900001
Are you... sick?

###16900303###16900403
Inosuke... Inosuke...

###16900305###16900405
Pro-... tect...

###16900306###16900406
the young... master... you hear...?

###16900308###16900408
We're counting on you... 

###16900401###27900101
The Dragonrot...

###16900404###16910009
... Yes?

###16900407###26900709
... All right.

###16900500
Ohh... Inosuke...

###16900501
Thank you... I can breathe more easily now

###16900502
With such a fine son...

###16900503
What more... could a mother ask for...

###16900600
Ohhh, Inosuke...

###16900601
I don't know who he is...

###16900602
but there's a man out there who's terribly ill...

###16900603
I can't help but worry...

###16900700
That sick man out there... sounds like he's gotten better.

###16900701
Heheh... Oh, Inosuke...

###16900702
Your mother saw you give him that medicine.

###16900703
What a compassionate son I have...

###16900704
I want you to know your mother is very proud.

###16910000###23002008###31910100
Here...

###16910001
Inosuke... what is this...?

###16910002
... Medicine.

###16910003###18910103###22011503###22011603###22012003
Thank... you...

###16910005###17910008###17910106
(Sighs)

###16910006
You'll feel better... in no time

###16910008###30110000
You...

###16910010
You're... a fine son...

###16910102
Ahh... The young... master...

###17001000
Ah... I know you.

###17001001
.........Yeah.

###17001002
You're that good sir, Shinobi, sir!

###17001003
I haven't seen you since, well, since that night.

###17001010
And uh... how do I say this...
You strike me as a man with real short temper...

###17001100
Good sir, I'm so glad you're safe.

###17001101
I haven't seen you since that night.

###17001200
I've been waiting for you, good sir!

###17001201
I've procured some goods with the coin you gave me.

###17001202###17001301
Go on, buy something.

###17001300
Greetings!  Thanks for your business, good sir!

###17001400
Hey, good sir.

###17001401
I found out what the samurai want.

###17001402
You mean it, good sir?!

###17001403
Yes, it seems they're low on salt.

###17001404
Salt, you say...?

###17001405
Well you eat it, of course. But it's also good for purifying the dead, and putting on wounds...

###17001406
Diseases spread quick with rotten corpses on the battlefield.

###17001407
Everyone's scrambling for salt...

###17001408
That means...

###17001409
Now's the time to cash in!

###17001411
Lots of people need salt.
I mean, Karma shouldn't bite me if I sell it for a tad more than the going rate, right?

###17001412
Now that that's decided, it's time to get me some salt.

###17001413
Thank you very much, good sir.

###17001500
Now then, how do I get me some salt...

###17001501
Oh, good sir, are you going to buy something?

###17001600
Good sir, good sir! Listen here.

###17001601
My salt? I sold it for quite a pretty price. You know, it's in high demand.

###17001602
And that means
I'm loaded with cash and product!

###17001603
Look, look, I've got some new items too.
Buy something, please!

###17001700
Good sir, you have one hell of an eye on you!

###17001701
You've found me a fine specimen.

###17001702
Not only is he strong, but he doesn't mind looting corpses neither.

###17001703
Thanks to you
I've got piles of weapons, and I'm loaded with cash!

###17001704
Not to mention some new items in stock.

###17001705
Here, have a look.

###17001800
Good sir... How uh... are you?

###17001801###17001901
......... What's wrong?

###17001802
Oh, well, well... it's... it's bad.

###17001803
Well, as it turns out, I'm in a bit of trouble. Again. Those government bastards... I made an offer for them to look the other way, you know.

###17001804
And they weren't as... amenable as I'd hoped.   They took it all... my money, my stock, everything.

###17001805
But... Kotaro drove them all away, at least...

###17001806
Right, pal?

###17001808
The big guy's fallen asleep.

###17001809
.........Yes, he's sleeping soundly.

###17001810
Please... don't make that face...

###17001811
There's nothing for you to be sad about, good sir.

###17001813
Oh that's right... good sir...

###17001814
I stowed away something good... something just for you.

###17001815
My last piece of product...

###17001816
Interested?

###17001900
Damn you, good sir!

###17001902
... Hm? Huh?

###17001903
Apologies.

###17001904
That's strange, for some reason
I just flipped out when I saw your face.

###17001905
Apologies. Allow me to get myself together...

###17001906
Go on, please buy something, good sir.

###17010000
Gah hah hah. Playing the damn fool again I see.

###17010001
We're the same, you and I. We know how to turn a crisis in our favour.

###17010002
Don't tell me you didn't make a killing when those bandits hit the Hirata Estate?

###17010003
A pal of mine snatched a "firey pipe" from that mansion.

###17010004
If you blew fire from that thing, "Red Ogre" over there would bawl like a baby.

###17010100
If you had that "firey pipe" that was at the Hirata Estate--

###17010101
"Red Ogre" over there would soil his pants! Gah hah hah.

###17010102
The Hirata Estate had other things besides the fiery pipe.
Shinobi gunpowder or something like that.

###17010800
What night?

###17010801
... Hmm? You don't remember?

###17010803###22003401
Oh...

###17010804
I see... You don't remember... Hmmm...

###17010805
... Listen, sir.

###17010806
You and I, we've met before.

###17010807
I was a thief back then.

###17010808
But those days are behind me! Now, I'm an upright and honest merchant!

###17010809
Only problem is, I'm broke.

###17010810
And being broke, I don't have anything to sell.

###17010811
So, good sir, would you mind
lending me just a few coins to get my business going?

###17010812###17011202
I'll stock something useful just for you. You bet I will!

###17010813###17011203
And, as a little bonus...
I'll tell you all about "that night".

###17010814###17011204
What do you think? Pretty good deal, right?

###17010901
Looks like you made it out safely, good sir.
That's sure a relief.

###17011000###17011900
Here's some coin.

###17011001###17011901
Thanks, good sir.

###17011002###17011902
Now talk.

###17011003###17011903
Yes, yes, yes, yes, of course.

###17011004###17011904
That night...

###17011005###17011905
My gang broke into the Hirata estate.

###17011006###17011906
Now as you're aware, the Hirata family's part of the Ashina.
Normally they'd mop the floor with petty thieves like us, no sweat.

###17011007###17011907
But it just so happens we broke in during a battle.
Almost all the young samurai were away from home.

###17011008###17011908
It was a prime opportunity.
Then... we started a fire and cleaned out the place.

###17011009###17011909
That there's when I met you.

###17011010###17011910
You were looking for something...
At least that's what it looked like to me.

###17011011###17011911
That's all I know about that night.

###17011012###17011912
.........I see.

###17011013
...Yeah.

###17011014
That look you're making now, you had that same look on your face that night.

###17011015
You still looking for something?

###17011017###17011913
... Listen, good sir.

###17011018###17011914
For a price,
I might be able to tell you some other tidbits you might find useful.

###17011019###17011915
For a price, of course. I'm a merchant, now, you know.

###17011101
Oh...? That's a shame.

###17011102
If you change your mind, you know where to find me.

###17011103
It's not a bad deal
for either of us, I don't think.

###17011200
Have you changed your mind, good sir?

###17011201
If you could just provide me with a little bit of coin...

###17011300###17011400###17011500###17011600###17011700###17011800
I'll buy some information.

###17011301###17011401###17011501###17011601
Thank you very much for your patronage!

###17011302###17011402###17011502###17011602
Hmmm... Since you're a shinobi,

###17011303###17011403###17011503###17011603
I'll give you some information about shinobi tools.

###17011304###17011404###17011504###17011604
If you could...

###17011305###17011405###17011505###17011605
I've seen this tube...
"a tube with fire blasting out of it".

###17011306###17011406###17011506###17011606
When we broke into the Hirata estate
one of my pals nabbed one.

###17011307###17011407###17011507###17011607
(Makes explosive sounds with mouth)

###17011308###17011408###17011508###17011608
That's the sound the fire makes when it blasts out.

###17011309###17011509
A fire-shooting tube at the Hirata estate...

###17011310###17011510###17011709
I'll keep that in mind.

###17011311
I've still got more information if you're keen to buy it.

###17011409###17011609
... I have one.

###17011410###17011610
I'll tell you that... What?!

###17011411###17011611
I said I already have one.

###17011412###17011612
Oh. Well. Well... that's a shame.

###17011413###17011613
That one's on me.

###17011414
I've got more juicy tidbits if you're up to paying.

###17011701###17011801
Thanks for your business, good sir!

###17011702###17011802
Hmm... This information is about another shinobi tool.

###17011703###17011803
I overheard someone talking about some
"gunpowder that goes bang real loud".

###17011704###17011804
He's a grave-robbing merchant.

###17011705###17011805
And where is this merchant's shop?

###17011706###17011806
A gingko tree at the top of a cliff marks the spot for his shop.

###17011707###17011807
Graverobbers trade in secret, you see.

###17011708###17011808
It's not honest work... that's probably why.

###17011710
I'm all outta information for now.
Thanks for your business, good sir.

###17011809
...I already know.

###17011810
Huh...?

###17011811
I know about him.

###17011812
Oh... I guess that happens sometimes.

###17011813
That one's on the house, good sir.

###17011814
And with that... I'm all outta information.
Thanks for your business.

###17011815
His shop's perched up on a cliff.

###17012000
Oh, good sir... Looks like you don't have enough coin.

###17020300
I'll procure some goods with the coin you gave me.

###17020301
Look forward to it, good sir.

###17020400
By the way, good sir. I'm going to let you in on something.

###17020402
I'm thinking about expanding my business.

###17020403
I mean, who knows when Ashina will fall...
It's what you might call -- a sinking ship.

###17020404
... In other words, opportunity is knocking, you know?

###17020405
Which is why I have a favor to ask of you.

###17020407
Do you mind finding out what
the Ashina samurai want right now?

###17020408
You tell me that, and I can sell it to them.

###17020409
You're a shinobi.

###17020410
I bet you've got a good ear for gathering information from the enemy.

###17020411
Help a poor merchant out here, please.

###17020500###17020600###17020700###17020900
Until next time, good sir.

###17020501
Come again soon!

###17020601
What do the Ashina samurai want right now?

###17020602
Please tell me when you find out.

###17020701
I'll stock some new products if I can sell a lot of salt.

###17020702
Make sure you pay me a visit when I do!

###17020800
Oh, good sir! Listen here.

###17020801
Is this about your business?

###17020802
You know me so well, good sir.

###17020803
It smells like a war's brewing these days...

###17020804
I could make a killing if I take advantage of this.

###17020805
Which is why I have a favor to ask of you, good sir.

###17020807
Looting battlefields, that's the job.

###17020808
That's a great way to refresh my stock, right?

###17020809
There are dead bodies all over a battlefield.

###17020810
It's a gold mine! 
Spears, swords, armor -- it's all free and for the taking!

###17020811
Weapons should fly off the shelves thanks to the war preparations.

###17020812
What qualifications do you need?

###17020813
Let's see...
Looting the battlefield is a dirty, physical job.

###17020814
I'm looking for someone who's big and strong... and thick!

###17020901
I'm counting on you to find someone to help with the battlefields!

###17020902
Someone big and strong, please.

###17021000
Thanks to you, sales are soaring higher than a dragon!

###17021001
Maybe one day soon
I'll be the top merchant in all of Ashina.

###17021002
If you're ever in a pinch, I'll hire you in a flash.

###17021004
You're a hard fish to land.  Playing hard to get, I like it.

###17021005
In any case, come again soon.

###17021101
And uh, about that product...

###17021102
I hid it in my underwear so...
It might smell a bit ripe... Sorry...

###17021103
I don't mind.

###17021104
And with that...
I'm all sold out... Time to close up shop.

###17021105
But you know... I'm not completely cleaned out.

###17021106
I still have this one sen.

###17021107###17021109
Uh huh.

###17021108
I'll... I'll take this one sen and turn it into a mountain of gold.

###17021110
When that happens... good sir, please come back to buy... something...

###17021200
Those...

###17021201
Those are some... tight purse strings you got.

###17031000
Please stop!

###17031100
What are you doing, good sir?!

###17031200
Good sirrr!

###17031201
You wanna have a go?

###17031300###17031401
Good sir...

###17031301
I’m sad it ended this way...

###17031402
How... terrible...

###17031700
What's your problem?!

###17031701
Have it your way. Let's get 'em, Kotaro!

###17100200
Hey, good sir. Are you a looter, too?

###17100202
Good sir, you look like... a shinobi, I think.
Are you looking for something?

###17100203
Well, in any case, I found this place first, so...

###17100204
Keep your eyes peeled out there, huh?
And, ya know, don't let the door hit ya on the...

###17100206
......... Oh, by the way.

###17100207###17100301
While I was on my way here
I saw a three-story pagoda on top of some cliff.

###17100208###17100302
It was a fine pagoda... really fine.

###17100209###17100303
I bet there's some kind of treasure kept in there. Gotta be.

###17100210###17100304
That's what I think, at least.

###17100300
Hey, good sir. Keep your eyes peeled out there.

###17130000
I'm not one to slice and swing...

###17130001
But I don't got a choice.

###17130100
Well then...

###17130101
Make sure you loot my corpse well.

###17130200
Damn... you...

###17900000###17900100
Sir...

###17900002###17900102
Wel-... come...

###17900003###17900103
Well... what... what'll it be...?

###17900004###17900104
Nothing right now...

###17900005###17900105
Not a thing... I see...

###17900007###17900107###26910000###30210000
Hey...

###17900008###17900108
I'm... I'm going...

###17900009###17900109
Out of... business if this... keeps up.

###17900101
So... you've caught it as well.

###17900200
Oh good sirrr!

###17900201###26900501
I'm all better now thanks to the medicine you gave me.

###17900202
Now I can put all my energy into selling my wares again.

###17900203
Thank you, good sir!

###17900204
Don't mention it...

###17900205
Hey, sir? You remember our agreement, don't you?

###17900206
Right. I'll buy something.

###17900300###30900300
It's easier to... to breathe now...

###17900301
Thank... you... kindly.

###17900700
Ahh, Good sir...

###17900701
Kotaro's come down with something serious...

###17900702
I'm worried about him, but I gotta keep workin'.

###17900703
Can't expect to nurse someone back to health with no money!

###17900800
Good sir!

###17900801
Take a look at Kotaro here.

###17900802
He's all better!

###17900803
(Cackle.) What a relief!

###17900804
By the way, good sir...

###17900805
I've got a real bargain for you today.

###17910000###17910100###29910000###30910000###41900100###42900100###43900100###44900100###45900100###46900100###47900100
Drink this...

###17910001
What... what's it cost...?

###17910002
Don't worry about it...

###17910003
I... couldn't...

###17910004
I'll take one sen.

###17910005
(Laughs to himself)

###17910006###17910104
Now, drink.

###17910009###17910107###29910003###30910003
You'll be better in no time.

###17910010
Many thanks...

###17910011
By the way, sir...

###17910012
What'll... you have...?

###17910013
Sure. Maybe I will buy something.

###17910014
(Cackles to himself)

###17910101
I... don't have any... right now...

###17910102
You can pay me back later.

###17910103
That's fine by me...

###17910108
(Wheezing and chuckling)

###17910202
Ugh... damn it...

###17920000
Heheh... That's a bargain right there.

###17920001
You have quite the eye for quality.

###18000000###18000100
(Shallow breathing)

###18000001
Who is it?  Is... somebody there?

###18000101
Sir, is it you again?

###18000102
Please...
Look after the old woman in that house.

###18000103
She doesn't know who anybody is anymore

###18000104
She may have lost her mind, but she's still my mother...

###18000200###18100200
......Ahh... Mother.

###18000201###18100201
Until the end... The young master...

###18000202###18100202
Heheheh... 

###18000301
Sir?  The man from before, right...?

###18000302
I wanted to thank you for humoring my mother...

###18010001###18010201###18010301
......That voice...

###18010002###18010202###18010302
No... Could it be?

###18010003###18010203###18010303
Sir?

###18010004###18010204###18010304
My name is Inosuke Nogami.
A vassal of the Hirata family... or at least I was.

###18010005###18010205###18010305
I ask a favor...
Might you look in on the old lady in that house?

###18010006###18010306
She's my mother, but...

###18010007###18010307
Her mind is failing... she cannot tell one from another.

###18010101
Sir?  ...perhaps I'm imagining things...

###18010308
... I met your mother.

###18010309
She gave me a bell.

###18010310
She did, did she...? You have my thanks.

###18010311
That bell's troubled her for a long, long time.

###18010312
She kept muttering incoherently... something about offering it to Buddha...

###18030000
Urgggh...

###18030001
Sir... What are...

###18030200###28030200
Stop...

###18100000
You... The young master's...

###18100001
I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

###18100002
Dreadful illusion techniques...

###18100003
Without a Snap Seed, it cannot be overcome.

###18100004###26001114###28010202
Take this.

###18100005
It's not much... but it's what I have.

###18100100
Listen... without a Snap Seed, you cannot overcome that illusion technique.

###18100101
I tried my best to be his guardian, but look at me now.

###18100102
The Hirata line is finished...
I must save my mother at the very least...

###18130000
Ughhh...

###18130001
You... What are...

###18900000###18900100
(Wheeze, wheeze, wheeze)

###18900001
Your breathing... Are you sick...?

###18900003###18900103
Someone... any-... one...

###18900004###18900104
I'm here...

###18900005
M-... My... mother...

###18900007###18900107
Don't force it. You'll only make it worse...

###18900008###18900108
Forget about... me...

###18900009###18900109
My mother... help my mother...

###18900101
You have the Dragonrot too...

###18900102
(Hegh... hegh... hurh, ahhhh...)

###18900105
M-... My... mother... (Hegh!)

###18900106
(Hegh, hegh, hegh!)

###18900200
Hm...? Oh it's you...

###18900201
I could barely breathe before but... I feel better now.

###18900202
You... saved me.

###18900204
Somehow, I survived once again...

###18900205
.........Forgive me, young master.

###18900600
Ahhh... I can hear her wheezing.

###18900601
Mother... Mother...

###18900602
Augh!  Why won't these legs of mine move?

###18900603
(Holding back tears)

###18900700
Mother's wheezing... it stopped.

###18900701
(crying)... thank god...

###18910001###18910101
What... is this...?

###18910002###18910102
Medicine for your illness...

###18910003
I can hear... my mother... wheezing..

###18910004
Forget about me... My mother...

###18910005
All right...

###18910104###31910103###31910206
(gulps)

###18910105###27910002###29910002
(Ahhhh......)

###18910106
You'll be better soon.

###18910108
I... thank you...

###18910109
I'm not ready to die... not yet...

###18910201
(Wheezing...)

###18910202
My... dear mother...

###19000000
A-After the battle--

###19000001
I collect "valuables" and bring them to Master Anayama.

###19000002
Then I get to eat a cooked meal.

###19000003
Oh, Master Anayama is a wonderful person.

###19000004
He set us free from the "Hirata Estate".

###19000100
Muh? You... 

###19000101
Seen you before... 

###19000102
Haven't I?

###19000200
Hot... So hot... 

###19000201
It burns... It burns... 

###19000202
I'm burning up... 

###20000000
Eek!

###20000001
....Wh-Who are you?

###20000002
I'm not a thief.

###20000003
(panting) ...Y-You're the young lord's!  Oh, thank goodness.

###20000004
Honorable Shinobi, those filthy bandits are after the young lord.  

###20000005
They've already climbed the hill and set the estate on fire.

###20000006
It looked as if the young lord had no way to escape...

###20000007
I entrust this to you.

###20000008
I beg of you, Shinobi.
Please rescue the young lord.

###20000009###22010615###23110403###70070004###70102000
I will.

###20000100
The young lord should still be somewhere within the estate.

###20000101
Honorable Shinobi, please save the young lord!

###20000102
May the fortunes of war bless you.

###20000103
I pray it is of help.

###20000200
There's a Small Shrine nearby.  A shinobi tool is kept inside.

###20000201
That key I gave you should open the door.

###20000300
Shinobi, sir, did you find the shrine?

###20000301
Yes, you have my thanks.

###20000302
No, I'm glad to have been of help.

###20000303
The thieves seemed to have been searching for something...
They might be after the young master

###20000304
The young master should still be in the mansion atop the bamboo thicket slope

###20000305
May the fortunes of war bless you, shinobi.

###20000400
I'm certain the young lord is in the estate mansion atop the bamboo thicket slope...

###20000401
Honorable Shinobi, please...
please take care of the young lord.

###21000000###21000100
(Panting)

###21000001
You've done well to come this far. 

###21000002
For a rogue, you are a worthy shinobi.

###21000003
My duty is to protect the young lord, lord Kuro!

###21000004
Lord Isshin would never forgive me should I fail.

###21000005
Let us fight together!

###21000101
That fight was hard...on this old body...

###21000102
Go on ahead.

###21000201
Looks like this place is clear.

###21030000###26030300###26030600###29030300
What are you doing?!

###21030001###25030200###36030100
Stop!

###21030100
Nothing but a rogue after all!

###21030101
I am betrayed!

###21030200
You...bastard...

###21030201
You...have no honor...

###21060000
You peasant!

###21060001
The young lord is under my protection!

###21060100
Hear me! My name is Nogami Gensai!

###21060101
I stood with the Ashina when they claimed this land!

###21060200
I...I've failed...

###21060201
Lord... Ku...ro...

###22000000###22000100
"So you wish to severe the immortal curse.
I will tell you what I know"

###22000200###22000300
"It seems you have found a Sacred Treasure"

###22000400###22000500
"You have the Sacred Treasures from the Valley and Village.
The last Sacred Treasure lies with the Prince himself"

###22000600
"Now you have all Sacred Treasures, head to the altar deep in the Fountainhead Village.
The path to the Sunken Capital is now open"

###22000700
"I sense something is wrong. Return to the Prince at the Main Castle"

###22000800
"You have defeated the Sakura Dragon and claimed its Tears"

###22000900
Talk: After defeating Mermaid Dragon_2nd time

###22001000
Speak: Noticed the connection between the Prince and the Protagonist

###22001100
Speak: Convey the secrets of the Mortality Blade to the Protagonist

###22001200
Why do you seek this place?

###22001201
I seek the Mortal Blade.

###22001202
Do you know of the blade that cannot be drawn?

###22001204###22001300
It is so-called, for not one who has drawn it has ever survived.

###22001205###22001301
Yet, you still wish to attempt this?

###22001400
I see you serve the Divine Heir of the Dragon's Heritage.

###22001402
Why do you seek the Mortal Blade?

###22001403
To sever the ties of immortality.

###22001404
the ties of immortality.

###22001406
The Divine Heir begrudges the power of the Dragon's Heritage.

###22001407###22002423###22004921###31010000###32000305###47010000###47010200###47110000
That's right.

###22001408
How strange fate can be.

###22001409
I am... one of the children of the Rejuvenating Waters.

###22001410
Created by those who would stop at nothing to achieve immortality,
my false dragon's blood was created by man.

###22001411
...children... so there are many of you?

###22001412
I am the only one who survived the process.

###22001413
The others... are laid to rest here.

###22001415
I do not know if it is right to sever the ties of immortality.

###22001416
But the Dragon's Heritage undeniably corrupts the lives of men...

###22001417
And I share the Heir's feelings about that truth.

###22001418###22001600###22002437###22002500###22002600###22002620###22002700###22002800###22002900###22003000###22003100###22003500###22003600###22003700###22003802###22003900###22004200###22004400###22004500###22004700###22004933
Shinobi of the Divine Heir.

###22001419
I have decided to assist you.

###22001420
Please, hold out your hand...

###22001422###22011702
Bless us with bountiful harvest...

###22001423
This is... rice...?

###22001424
There you are.

###22001425
Rice is a precious thing.

###22001426
It tastes better the more you eat it, and restore's one vigor.

###22001436
It tastes sweeter the more you eat it, and makes one stronger.

###22001440
I wish to obtain the dragon tears from the divine realm...

###22001450
I see... I have read about this.

###22001451
I have read there is a way to sever the Dragon's Heritage.

###22001453###24100012
Which means...

###22001500###22004300
I apologize... Shinobi of the Divine Heir.

###22001501###22004301
The rice is not yet ready for harvest.

###22001502
I shall give you more when the harvest is complete.

###22001590
Please make the most of the rice you have left. 

###22001601
This time the rice grew well.

###22001602###22004202
Now, hold out your hand...

###22001603
Please.

###22001604
Bless us with bountiful harvest.

###22001605###22011801###22011937
I thank you.

###22001606
Rice is very precious.

###22001607
Please come again should you want for more.

###22001700
(Soft snoring)

###22001701
......... Ahem.

###22001702
... Oh......

###22001703
Shinobi of the Divine Heir...

###22001704
I awaited... your return.

###22001800
(Pant, pant, pant...)

###22001802
I'm glad you've come... Shinobi of the Divine Heir...

###22001804
It is... nothing serious...

###22001805
More importantly, your rice...

###22001806
Hold on.

###22001807
You don't look well... Rest.

###22001808
......... Yes.

###22001809
I understand...

###22001810
... what can I do?

###22001812
Is there something I can get you?

###22001813
Well, then... then I'd like to eat a persimmon.

###22001900
I am sorry I am unable... to give you any rice...

###22001901
Try to sleep.

###22001902
I'll find a persimmon.

###22001903###22010603
Yes, thank you.

###22002000
You've come to visit... Shinobi of the Divine Heir.

###22002100
Did you give the rice to the Divine Heir?

###22002102
He made rice balls out of it.

###22002103
The Divine Heir of the Dragon's Heritage... he made them himself?

###22002104
Yes, and he was enthusiastic.

###22002105
And I had one... it was very good.

###22002106
That's good to hear.

###22002107
...... Oh, I see.

###22002108
Hey may be the Divine Heir of the Dragon's Heritage, but... he's still human, after all.

###22002109
What am I saying, of course he is...

###22002110
I'm sure he had his doubts about severing immortality as well...

###22002111
Yet even so, it is the path he chose.

###22002112
There is something I would like to ask you, Shinobi of the Divine Heir...

###22002113###22002438###22004934###23003201###23102301###24000001###24001003
Yes?

###22002114
What is his name?

###22002116
Lord Kuro... It has a fine ring to it...

###22002117
I should like to meet him some day.

###22002190
He did?

###22002191
They were delicious.

###22002200###22002300
My friends... What should I do...?

###22002201###22002301
With the severing of immortality...

###22002202###22002302
I will once more... lose something precious...

###22002203###22002303
I cannot help but feel this way.

###22002304
Is this something I should be concerned about?

###22002305
What the scriptures described...

###22002306
The fate of the Dragon Heritage...

###22002400###22004900
I... don't want to lose them.

###22002403###22004903
But... if I were to choose the path of Returning the Dragon's Heritage...

###22002404###22004904
It may come to pass that I would have to leave all of you.

###22002407###22004907
Thank you for your kind words...

###22002410
My friends, listen...

###22002411###22004911
He is... actually quite kind.

###22002412###22004912
He gave me this...

###22002413###22004913###28010000###32000501###70010001
Hello?

###22002414###22004914
Oh, Shinobi of the Divine Heir... I didn't hear you come in.

###22002417###22004915
It is thanks to you that I've been able to have a deep... conversation with my friends.

###22002418###22004916
With the children of the rejuvenating waters?

###22002420###22004918
... There is something I would like to discuss.

###22002421###22004919
I believe we should aim not to sever the Dragon's Heritage,
but instead to return it to its rightful place.

###22002422###22004920
Return the Dragon's Blood?

###22002425###22004922
The Dragon's Heritage was... set free from its homeland and it drifted here to Japan.

###22002426###22004923
Its power was never meant for this land.

###22002427###22004924
Until something is done, it will continue to corrupt the lives of those who encounter it.

###22002428###22004925
The Dragon's Heritage and those connected to it... It is only right that they return home.

###22002430###22004926
To the west... To the birthplace of the divine dragon...

###22002431###22004927
However, there is one problem... I am unsure of the exact destination.

###22002432###22004928
Who would know?

###22002433###22004929
Perhaps the High Priest of Senpou Temple... or...

###22002434###22004930
And he is?

###22002435###22004931
He's the founder of Senpou Temple.
I wonder how old he actually is...

###22002436###22004932
He has secluded himself in a five story pagoda, past the narrow cave not far from here.

###22002439###22004935
This path... differs from that of the one to sever immortality.

###22002440###22004936
I do not wish to force my opinion upon you.

###22002441###22004937
Should you wish to return the Dragon's Heritage,
then perhaps you should seek out the High Senpou Priest.

###22002442###22004938
... I'll think about it.

###22002452###22004990
He has secluded himself in the shrine near the great bell.

###22002462
He is confined within the narrow cave, not far from here.

###22002472
He can be found in the narrow cave, not far from the Inner Sanctum.

###22002482
He is confined just beyond the narrow cave not far from here.

###22002501
Should you wish to return the Dragon's Heritage, seek out the holy Senpou priest.

###22002502
His Reverence is confined within the five story pagoda beyond the entrance to the Buddha statue.

###22002510
His Reverence is confined within the enshrinement hall near the great bell.

###22002520
His Reverence is within the narrow cave, not far from here.

###22002530
His Reverence is confined within the narrow cave, not far from here.

###22002540
His Reverence has confined himself just beyond the narrow cave, not far from here.

###22002601
Have you perhaps met with the High Priest of Senpou Temple?

###22002602
I found him, but he was dead.

###22002603
The High Priest was infested... How could this come to be...?

###22002604
I do not know.  However, he left this note.

###22002608
The tears of the dragon...

###22002609
I am sure they can be obtained from the Divine Dragon, the source of the Dragon's Heritage.

###22002610
However I don't know what he means by "cold" here...

###22002611
Consuming two persimmons of the serpent will allow one
to become a cradle for the Divine Heir.

###22002612
This will make it possible to return the Dragon's Heritage to its homeland...

###22002613
......... I...

###22002614
I shall become the cradle.

###22002615
... You're sure of this?

###22002618
I am the only surviving Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters.

###22002619
Death does not come easily to me.

###22002621###22002701
If you wish to take the path to return the Dragon's Heritage, then bring me two persimmons of the serpent.

###22002622
Where should I begin?

###22002623###22003002###22003102
I believe it is said that the liver of a Great Serpent...

###22002624###22003003###22003103
Is stained red like a Persimmon.

###22002801###22002901
I see you have obtained one persimmon of the serpent.

###22002802
They say there is a Great Serpent nest at the bottom of the Sunken Valley. 

###22002803###22003105
Perhaps that is where you will find the remaining persimmon.

###22002902
I need one more to perform the cradle ritual.

###22003001###22003101
If you wish to take the path to return the Dragon's Heritage, I require two persimmons of the serpent.

###22003200
Shinobi of the Divine Heir.
Have you acquired both persimmons of the serpent?

###22003300###22003301
(Divine Child is writhing in pain beyond the door)

###22003402
Shinobi of the Divine Heir...?

###22003403
Are you... there?

###22003404
You... your eyes...

###22003405
Ahh.. You have returned.

###22003406
Shinobi of the Divine Heir?

###22003407
It appears... I have succeeded in becoming the cradle.

###22003408
Could you please take my hand?

###22003410
What...!

###22003411
It is cold... Much like an ice house.

###22003412
Which is why...

###22003413
See? My tears... They freeze as they flow down my face.

###22003414
These frozen tears... take them.

###22003415
Frozen tears... does this mean...?

###22003417
I believe this is what the text referred to as "Cold Dragon Tears"

###22003418
The Divine Heir must drink them together with the Dragon Tears of the divine realm.

###22003419
If he does so,
I believe Lord Kuro will be able to rest within the cradle.

###22003501
What would you ask of me?

###22003601###22003701
So you've acquired the Tears of the Dragon.

###22003602
Yes, I have them here.

###22003703
The Tears of the Dragon...

###22003704
If Lord Kuro drinks them together with the frozen tears I provided...

###22003705
Then he will be able to rest within my cradle.

###22003800###22004000
If you wish to return the dragon's heritage to its rightful place, give him the frozen tears together with the dragon tears.

###22003801###22004001
He only needs but to drink them.

###22003803
Please search for the dragon tears.

###22004002
If he does so, he will be able to rest within my cradle.

###22004100
(giggles)

###22004102
Hold out your hand...

###22004104###22004204
Bless us with a silvery harvest...

###22004106###22004205
It's cold...

###22004107
With my body so cold...
the rice shines with an icy gleam.

###22004108
It's like fine snow.

###22004109
That is true.

###22004110
Then that is what we shall call it.

###22004111
Shinobi of the Divine Heir, this fine snow is yours.

###22004112
I accept.

###22004113###22004206
Rice is precious.

###22004114###22004207
Please return should you want for more.

###22004201
The fine snow has fallen with such a glisten to it.

###22004302
I will provide more when the harvest is complete.

###22004401
I look forward to the time we next meet.

###22004501
I pray that you will bring Lord Kuro
safely to me.

###22004701
You are welcome here.

###22004801
Shinobi of the Divine Heir... You've come to see me...

###22004901
(They are important, aren't they?)

###22004902
(Then let's look for a way to return the Dragon's Heritage rather than to sever immortality.)

###22004905
(You don't have to worry about us.)

###22004906
(You have prayed more than enough for us.)

###22004908
(But, can you really trust him?)

###22004909
(He doesn't say much and he has a scary look.)

###22004910
(Giggle...) My friends, listen...

###22005100
I will eat the two persimmons,
and become the cradle to return the Dragon's Heritage to its rightful place.

###22005101
I will require a little time, but please return soon.

###22010002
Another is enshrined in the Bodhisattva Valley.

###22010100
"A Sacred Treasure can be found in the Bodhisattva Valley, behind Ashina Castle"

###22010200
A Sacred Treasure can be found in the Fountainhead Village, beyond the Abandoned Dungeon"

###22010300
 "With Immortal Edge, you can finish off evil immortal beasts infested with parasites"

###22010401
I see... Very well.

###22010501
If you have any doubt, I urge you to rethink this decision.

###22010502
The blade has claimed the lives of many.

###22010600
I found a persimmon.

###22010601
Truly, you've brought me a persimmon?

###22010602
Eat.

###22010604###22011802###22011904
(Munch... munch... munch...)

###22010605
It's sweet and delicious.

###22010607
Shinobi, hold out your hand.

###22010609
No need to hesitate.  Hold out your hand...

###22010611
A bountiful harvest for you.

###22010612
I thank you, Shinobi of the Divine Heir.

###22010613
The crop is plentiful, thanks to the persimmon you gave me.

###22010614
I ask that you also give some to the Divine Heir of the Dragon's Heritage.

###22010701
I am sorry I am unable to give you any rice...

###22010800###23001702
... Hello.

###22010801
Oh, Shinobi of the Divine Heir.

###22010802
You've come to see me.

###22011000###22011100###22011500###22011600###22012000
This is for you.

###22011002###23002501
I was told to give it to you.

###22011003
I will... take a look.

###22011005
I see... so the Dragon's Heritage... was originally...

###22011007
Thank you, Shinobi of the Divine Heir.

###22011008
What is written here...

###22011009
I will need to discuss at length with the other children.

###22011010###22031000
Please do.

###22011102
I'm supposed to give it to you.

###22011300
Yes, I've found them.

###22011301
This shade of red... It is as I expected.

###22011302
A persimmon is an apt comparison.

###22011303
You're actually going to eat them?

###22011305
Doing so will allow me
to become a cradle to return the Dragon's Heritage to its home.

###22011307
I hesitate to eat them in front of you.

###22011308
Please come back after some time.

###22011400
... Not yet.

###22011401
Is that so...

###22011402
Please continue your search.

###22011501###22011601###22012001###24110003###70001107
What is this...?

###22011502
I was told to give this to you.

###22011504###22011604###22012004
... I... will accept it.

###22011507###22011607###22012007
I... I still...

###22011508###22011608###22012008
Cannot help but detest them...

###22011602###22012002###22012090
I found a note saying I should give this to you.

###22011700
Please take this rice.

###22011703
... you have my gratitude.

###22011704
Of course... Rice, is a precious thing...

###22011705
Remember to chew properly before swallowing...

###22011800
I've brought a persimmon.  Eat.

###22011803
Sweet and delicious...

###22011804
Your persimmon has given me strength.

###22011900
I've brought a persimmon.

###22011901
Oh my!

###22011902
Eat it.

###22011903
Yes, I will.

###22011915
There's nothing quite like a persimmon.

###22011916
Nothing is so delicious...

###22011925
(Giggles)

###22011927
Oh, pay me no mind. The sweetness just brings me happiness.

###22011935
Whether I'm feeling well... or not...

###22011936
Persimmons never cease to be delicious.

###22011945
Oh my... this is...!

###22011946
What about it?

###22011947
So wonderfully sweet and delicious.

###22011948
Persimmons are truly crimson gems...

Farewell, Shinobi of the Divine Heir.

###22020501
May the harvest be plentiful wherever your path may lead.

###22020600
Thank you for visiting.

###22020700
So you will take your leave?

###22020701
Please do visit again.

###22030000
"Please, take your leave..."

###22030001
"This temple is home to immortal beings."

###22030002
"Beings that fear neither blade nor shinobi tricks."

"Do not throw away your life needlessly."

###22030004
"Leave now."

###22030600
You... Yes, you...

###22030601
Look this way... Gaze upon the image of the Enlightened One.

###22030700
Those of the Senpou Temple have strayed from Buddha's teachings.

###22030701
They have abandoned their faith, seduced by a search for immortality.

###22030702
Should you be captured, there is no telling what would become of you.

###22030703
You would do well to return the way you came.

###22030706
I will not stop you from entering if you are determined to do so.

###22030707
But if you do, please... proceed with care.

###22030800
I see you have decided to continue...

###22030801
We will pray for your safety... It is the least we can do.

###22030900
Do you know what this is?

###22030901
I believe it is known as...

###22030902
A sakura droplet.

###22030903
I have heard that when the immortal oath of the dragon's heritage is broken...

###22030904
A sakura droplet is produced in its stead.

###22030905
So this too represents the power of the dragon's heritage...

###22030908
... Shinobi of the Divine Heir.

###22030909
Should you so desire, I could use its power to aid you.

###22031002
Please close your eyes.

###22031011
It appears the Sakura Droplet's power now resides within you.

###22031012
I am glad I could be of assistance...

###22031013###23000301
I give you my thanks.

###22031100
I'd rather not.

###22031102
Should you require my aid, do not hesitate to ask.

###23000300
At long last I've managed to fulfill my master's orders.

###23000302
Who exactly... do you serve?

###23000303
Isshin Ashina.

###23000305
I am a doctor in the service of Lord Isshin.

###23000306
Why... were you ordered to help me?

###23000307
Lord Isshin has no desire to use the power of the Dragon's Heritage.

###23000308
That is why he...

###23000309
He tried to help Lord Kuro escape Ashina.

###23000310###23001442
Correct.

###23000311
The message I found in the well... that was your doing?

###23000312
Also correct.

###23000313
My duties have concluded. But...

###23000314###23000400
There's someone I think you'd like to see...

###23000315###23000401
Lord Kuro is downstairs.

###23000500
I see that you've spoken to Lord Kuro.

###23000501
I have.

###23000502
It's very slight but...

###23000503
It looks to me like your brow is less furrowed than before. 

###23000505
The Divine Heir has asked me to find Lord Isshin.

###23000506###23000600
My Lord is not in this castle keep, he is in one of the separate watchtowers.

###23000507###23000601
But Lord Isshin is not well, which is why entry into his tower is not allowed.

###23000651###23010051
Whether he truly is resting or not,
I could not tell you for certain.

###23000653###23010053
Lord Isshin likes going out for walks...

###23000654###23010054
If he isn't in that watchtower
then there might be a note left behind.

###23000700
So... Lord Isshin wasn't in his watchtower?

###23000701
No. But he left this.

###23000703
The Ashina Castle Gate, the place where you fought Lord Gyoubu the Demon...

###23000704###23000802
There is a watchtower near there on the Serpent Valley side.

###23000705###23000803
Perhaps you should head over that way?

###23000800
Lord Isshin was not in his watchtower.

###23000801
The Ashina Castle Gate, the place where you fought Lord Gyobu the Demon...

###23000900
So, you've met with Lord Isshin?

###23000901
Yes, he thanked me.

###23000902
For defeating Genichiro.

###23000904
To think that Lord Genichiro would go as far as to drink the Rejuvenating Sediment...

###23000905
Rejuvenating Sediment?

###23000906
That's what we call a particularly concentrated part of the Rejuvenating Waters.

###23000907
I'm sure you saw it for yourself.

###23000908
The Rejuvenating Sediment grants great resilience in one's flesh.  

###23000909
One becomes able to withstand blows that would be fatal to anyone else.

###23000910
My mentor Dogen devoted much research to its uses, but...

###23000911
all of his works -- documents, medicines, everything -- were burned and destroyed.

###23000912
I'm not sure who, but I heard one of the senior apprentices was able to salvage some of it.

###23000913
...... Probably Doujun.

###23000915
Did you ask... Lord Kuro's thoughts on the matter?

###23000917
And?

###23000918
We've decided to sever the ties of immortality.

###23000920
I thank you... for all of the help you've given me.

###23000921
Almost sounds like you're bidding me farewell for good.

###23000922
I've carried out my Lord's orders, so I will stay here in the castle.

###23000923
Come and speak to me whenever you please.

###23000924
I will provide my assistance to you as a doctor.

###23001000
There is something I would like to ask you.

###23001001###23002801
Yes, what is it?

###23001002
The sakura tree, behind the castle...

###23001003
You mean the Everblossom?

###23001004
It is a sakura tree that Lord Takeru brought from his homeland...

###23001005
So it's a sakura tree from the divine realm?

###23001006###23001413
Yes, it's quite a mysterious one at that...

###23001007###23001414
It was constantly in bloom, even outside of spring.

###23001008###23001415
However... the Everblossom no longer exists.

###23001009###23001416
It withered away.

###23001010###23001417###23111408
Why?

###23001011###23001418
There was a person who cut off a branch and took the flowers from the tree.

###23001012###23001102###23001419
Without its flowers, the Everblossom was unable to survive.

###23001013###23001103###23001420
Eventually the entire tree was lost.

###23001100
The Everblossom tree that Lord Takeru brought from his homeland...

###23001101
Someone cut a branch from the tree and took the flowers for themselves.

###23001200###23001400###23001703###23002300###23002400###23003000###23003200###23101000
Master Wolf...

###23001201
There is something I wish to tell you.

###23001203
If you continue along your path towards severing immortality...

###23001204
Lord Kuro... will lose his life.

###23001205
Explain yourself...

###23001206
Look at this...

###23001207
Something left behind by Lord Takeru...?

###23001208
It says...

###23001209
Dragon Tears alone are not
enough to sever immortality.

###23001210
You must also completely drain the blood of the Divine Heir.

###23001211
So that means he must...

###23001212
Yes. It means he must die.

###23001213
But my Lord cannot bleed.

###23001214
Not by normal means, no. That is true.

###23001215
But there is a way that it could be accomplished.

###23001216###23002830
... the Mortal Blade.

###23001218
The Mortal Blade is a sword that can kill even those who cannot die.

###23001219
With such a terrifying weapon, you could even kill the Divine Heir.

###23001221
But there must be a better way.

###23001222
I wish to find a path...

###23001223
where Lord Kuro need not be killed.  

###23001290
What is required for this task can be found in Senpou Temple.

###23001300
Is the Divine Heir aware...

###23001301
that immortal severance will mean his death?

###23001302
I think it likely he does...

###23001303
The book I gave you is on his bookshelf, and...

###23001304
he avidly reads everything on that shelf.

###23001305
I'm sure he has at least glanced through it.

###23001306
A path where Lord Kuro need not be killed...

###23001307
If that is what you wish to find, then please let me know.

###23001310
Are you sure the Divine Heir knows...

###23001311
That Immortal Severance will lead to his death?

###23001312
From what you've told me...
I believe he does.

###23001313
Lord Takeru's writings were on the Ashina Library's bookshelves...

###23001314
And Lord Kuro has been studying the books there voraciously.

###23001315
No doubt he understands the meaning of "beheading"...

###23001351
Even so, we should continue our investigation without involving him.

###23001352
I agree.

###23001360
... Master Wolf.

###23001361
I will not give up.

###23001362
There must be a path by which Lord Kuro need not die...

###23001363
Will you help me find it?

###23001403
Purification?

###23001404
Yes!  It says here...

###23001405
There is a way to cut the ties of the Dragon's Blood and transform its owner into a regular human being...

###23001406
The process requires a flower from the Everblossom.

###23001410
And that is?

###23001411
A special sakura tree that Lord Takeru brought from his native home.

###23001412
So it was a sakura tree from the divine realm?

###23001430
As I told you once before...

###23001431
The Everblossom is a sakura tree that Lord Takeru brought here from the divine realm.

###23001432
However, someone cut a branch from the tree and stole the flowers...

###23001433
and the Everblossom eventually dried and withered away.

###23001434
So the Everblossom tree has been entirely lost.

###23001440
If the tree itself no longer exists...

###23001441
The flowers don't exist either.

###23001443
But... the branch that was stolen did have flowers on it.

###23001444
So if it could be found...

###23001450
Is this the branch from the Everblossom tree?

###23001451###23001602
It was... in my father's possession.

###23001452###23001603
Master Owl...

###23001453
But there are no flowers on this branch.

###23001462
... It's nothing.

###23001463
I was just trying to remember back to when
the Everblossom still flourished...

###23001464
But try as I might, the memory is hazy...

###23001465
...... Their graves...

###23001467
I think I'll pay a visit to Lord Takeru and Lady Tomoe's graves.
That's where the Everblossom once grew.

###23001468
Something might come back to me.

###23001500
The Purification requires the Mortal Blade and flowers from the Everblossom. 

###23001501
I'll visit  the graves of Lord Takeru and Lady Tomoe.

###23001502
It may help me better remember the time when the Everblossom existed.

###23001503
By the way, if we are to perform the Purification...

###23001504
How would the Mortal Blade be used?

###23001505
... Now that you mention it, that part wasn't very clear.

###23001506
I will see what I can find.

###23001600
Master Wolf...  Is that...?.

###23001601
The branch from the Everblossom.

###23001604
But there are no flowers on this branch any longer.

###23001605
Perhaps too much time has passed.

###23001606
Yes. Unfortunately...

###23001607
We need to find flowers that are still intact.

###23001701
Ahhh... why must that be the only way?

###23001704
... How long have you been there?

###23001705
Have you remembered anything?

###23001707
Nothing, I'm afraid.

###23001708
... Nothing?

###23001709
That's right...

###23001710
I'm sorry... I wasn't able to remember anything significant.

###23001712
... Perhaps one of my old friends can help.

###23001713
I'll meet with Orangutan at his temple.

###23001714
Orangutan...?

###23001715
... Yes.  It's the Sculptor's old nickname...

###23001800
Back then...

###23001801
Lord Genichiro and I would come here a lot.

###23001802
Lord Takeru would play the flute and Lady Tomoe would dance under the Everblossom...

###23001803
It was a wonderful sight.

###23001805
... Perhaps one of my old friends
has some memories of those days.

###23001806
I'll speak with Orangutan at his temple.

###23001900
It never fails, Lord Isshin disappears the moment I take my eyes off of him.

###23001901
He's quite a handful...

###23002003
... has succumbed to his illness and passed away.

###23002004
......... I... see.

###23002005
I'm sure you sensed it.

###23002006
The Central Forces have taken this opportunity to attack the castle.

###23002007
And the Divine Heir?

###23002009
This key...

###23002010
... My lord has escaped the castle through the secret passage?

###23002011
Yes, Master Wolf.

###23002012###23002101
The secret passage can be found along the moat in the Ashina reservoir, not far from the Moon-view Tower.

###23002013
Lord Kuro escaped the castle through that secret passage
and should be waiting for you in the silvergrass field.

###23002014
... Understood.

###23002015###23002103###23002203
The Nightjar have left smoke signals on the roofs
under Lord Isshin's orders.

###23002016###23002104###23002204
The smoke should lead the way to Lord Kuro.

###23002100###23002200
Lord Kuro escaped the castle through the secret passage.

###23002102###23002202
He is waiting for you in the silvergrass field.

###23002110
... What about you?

###23002111
For the time being...

###23002112
I will remain by Lord Isshin's side.

###23002120
......... Master Wolf.

###23002122###23020100
I pray...

###23002123###23020101
that Lord Kuro achieves humanity.

###23002201
The secret passage can be found along the moat in the Ashina reservoir, not far from the Moon Tower.

###23002301
Lord Isshin left something to me.

###23002302###23002403
Please take it.

###23002304
A book containing the secret techniques of the Ashina Mushin style.

###23002306
"If Sekiro is able to master these...

###23002307###23002408
I'd like to duel him."

###23002308###23002409
... That is what he said.

###23002401
I see you've mastered a secret technique.

###23002402
It is now time to pass to you what Lord Isshin entrusted to me.

###23002405
A book containing the secret technique of the Ashina style.

###23002407
"If Sekiro is able to master this...

###23002500
Lord Isshin entrusted me with something.

###23002502
... But, it appears you aren't ready for it just yet.

###23002503
I will give it to you once you have mastered a secret technique.

###23002600
The item that Lord Isshin entrusted me with...

###23002601
It appears the time has not come for me to pass it on to you just yet.

###23002602
Please visit me again when you have mastered the Esoteric Teachings.

###23002700
I'm sorry... I'm not in the mood for drinking right now...

###23002710
Forgive me, but now's not a time for libations...

###23002800
There is something I'd like to ask...

###23002802
Can the Divine Heir be made to bleed?

###23002803
...Why would you seek to do so?

###23002804
The blood of the Divine Heir is required...

###23002805
to obtain the Dragon Tears from the Divine Realm,

###23002806
and achieve Immortal Severance.

###23002807
Oh... I see.

###23002808
It is true that the Divine Heir's blood cannot be shed by normal means.

###23002810
However, you currently possess the means to do so.

###23002820
However, the means to do so can be found in Senpou Temple.

###23002840
What are those means?

###23002841
A sword that can kill even those who cannot die...

###23002850
Here you are.

###23002851
This was written by Lord Takeru?

###23002852
It was.

###23002853
With the Mortal Blade...

###23002854
You may wound the Divine Heir and his blood will be allowed to flow...

###23002856
This brings us one step closer to Immortal Severance.

###23002857###23002903
I shall tell my lord.

###23002858###23002904
... Of course.

###23002900
As I told you before...

###23002901
The Mortal Blade should be able to wound the Divine Heir and allow his blood to be shed.

###23003001
It looks as if...

###23003002
Your brow is less furrowed than before... if only a little.

###23003004
Please, see that Lord Kuro's wish to sever immortality is met.

###23003100
Lord Kuro is...

###23003101
Bound to be the Divine Heir of the Dragon's Heritage for eternity.

###23003102
My wish is that...

###23003103
He could be freed of this burden and pursue a normal life.

###23003104
That is all I pray for.

###23003202
...I pray for your victory in battle.

###23010000
Is there a way to get in?

###23010001
The Nightjar ninja make use of a path along the rooftops.

###23010002
I'm not sure, but I believe they make use of smoke signals...

###23010004
So if you follow the Nightjar's smoke signals...

###23010005
You might be able to enter Isshin's tower from the roof.

###23010200
I will not let my Lord die.

###23010201###23010401
So we are in agreement.

###23010202###23010402
Do you have evidence of such a path?

###23010203###23010403
No, but... perhaps I will find something else in Lord Takeru's writings.

###23010204###23010404
I'll inform you if I do.

###23010206###23010406
Also, I think it best that we...

###23010207###23010407###23010740
Keep this from the Divine Heir.

###23010301
Severing the immortal ties is my master’s... That is the Divine Heir’s calling.

###23010302
I... understand.

###23010303
But if you change your mind, please tell me.

###23010400
I.... cannot allow my lord to die.

###23010410
Master Wolf... You have my thanks.

###23010501
I... see...

###23010600
The blood samples allowed me to discover a cure for the Dragonrot.

###23010601
The medicine can be created in exchange for some of your resurrective power.

###23010602
If you require the medicine, please let me know.

###23010700
"I must do, what must be done..."

###23010702
That is what the Divine Heir said.

###23010703
He must be hiding something.

###23010704
...I... see....

###23010707
Lord Takeru spoke of "beheading" in his memoirs.

###23010709
Perhaps the act of beheading...

###23010710
was the means to end immortality, along with the life of the Divine Heir.

###23010711###24100019
... What?

###23010712
If you walk the path of Immortal Severance...

###23010713
Then you must use the Mortal Blade to...

###23010714
...end my lord's life.

###23010715###23110502###24000014
... Yes.

###23010716
Lord Kuro desires Immortal Severance...
I understand that, I do.

###23010717
And yet... Master Wolf...

###23010718
Might there be a path where Lord Kuro need not lose his life?

###23010719
...The Dragon's Heritage is no ordinary power.

###23010720
There could be such a path.

###23010721
...Well then, Master Wolf.

###23010722
I ask you that you help me find such a path...

###23010723
A path where Lord Kuro need not die.

###23010730
I will not let my lord die.

###23010731###23100812###23100903###23110903
... Thank you.

###23010732
We must find a starting point.

###23010734###23110204
......... Hmm...

###23010735
...Oh yes, Lady Tomoe's...

###23010736
Master Wolf. I might have a place to start.

###23010737
I'll look into it, and let you know as soon as I find something.

###23010739
Also... we may want to...

###23010750
I refuse.

###23010751
Immortal Severance is what my lord desires.

###23010752
I... I understand.

###23010753
And yet, Master Wolf...

###23010754
Please tell me if you change your mind.

###23020000
Please, go to Lord Kuro.

###23060000###23060600
Shu-... ra...

###23060100
Lord... Isshin...

###23060200
So this... is the path... that you have chosen...

###23060300
Let us begin...

###23060400
Not... yet...

###23060401
I cannot allow... a Shura to roam free...

###23060500
Perhaps I should have killed you sooner.

###23060501
The moment I saw the shadow of Shura in your eyes...

###23100300
You truly... returned from the dead. 

###23100301
The power of the Dragon's Blood.

###23100302
I never thought I'd see it with my own eyes.

###23100303
Who are you?

###23100304
My name is Emma.

###23100305
I am a doctor serving a certain master.

###23100306
What master?

###23100307
Forgive me, but... for his safety, I cannot reveal his identity.

###23100308
However, my master gave explicit orders...

###23100309
to assist you in any way I can.

###23100311
I'm not telling you to trust me.

###23100312
However, I must fulfill my master's orders.

###23100313
The gourd of medicinal water you possess...

###23100314
That was originally a creation of mine.

###23100315
I am a doctor, and I will assist you in that capacity.

###23100400###23101500
I'm glad you've come, Master Wolf.

###23100500###23100600
Hmm...?

###23100502
Forgive me, but... please show me your face again.

###23100505
Hm...  Is it... the same as before?

###23100506
The mark... Your eyes... Hmm...

###23100508
......... Nothing.

###23100509
Your mark, I thought it seemed just a little darker...

###23100510
But it appears to have been my imagination.

###23100590###23102104###23110202
... Please, show me your face.

###23100602
As I thought... the difference is slight...

###23100603
...and I can only see it from up close...

###23100605
Dragon's Blood stagnation.

###23100606
I believe you're showing its symptoms.

###23100607
Stagnation?

###23100608
Dogen, my mentor, spoke of it once.

###23100609
The power of the Dragon's Heritage becomes tainted the more you use it.

###23100610
When the stagnation has built up too much, it overflows.

###23100611
What happens when it overflows?

###23100612
Diseases spread, apparently.

###23100613
I hope this is just me being unnecessarily cautious...

###23100614
But if you should notice anything alarming--

###23100615
Yes, I'll come see you.

###23100620
Stagnation of the Dragon's Eye.

###23100621
You may be showing symptoms of it.

###23100622
What... is the Dragon's Eye?

###23100623###23110700
My mentor Dogen spoke of it before.

###23100624
The power of the Dragon's Heritage stagnates if the one who uses it dies repeatedly.

###23100625
A symptom of this stagnation appears in the depths of one's pupils.

###23100626
This is called the Dragon's Eye.

###23100627
And my right eye is showing these symptoms?

###23100628
I believe so...

###23100629
And it's said that stagnation can build up in the Dragon's Eye to the point that it overflows...

###23100700
...Have you seen the Sculptor lately?

###23100701
Yes. He's...

###23100702
He's showing symptoms, yes.  I've come to believe...

###23100703
that the stagnation has exceeded its limit.

###23100704
And you said that stagnation overflowing may cause sickness...

###23100705
Yes. According to my mentor Dogen's research...

###23100706
That the Dragon's Heritage can bestow the power of resurrection.

###23100707
However, it is not any ordinary power.

###23100708
Repeated use leads to stagnation, which will eventually reach a point where it "overflows"...
This causes those who do not have the power to become sick.

###23100709
A disease known as Dragonrot.

###23100710
He knew much about it, but even so he was unable to determine a cure.

###23100711
Forgive me.

###23100712
... Is there a way to treat this Dragonrot?

###23100713
I do not know. However, it must be stopped...

###23100714
I am unsure, but the first step is to look through my mentor's research and see if I can discover a way...

###23100790
I don't understand.  What is stagnation?

###23100791
All I know is what Dogen told me long ago.

###23100800
What are you doing?

###23100801
.........Hm? Oh, I didn't realize you were here.

###23100802
The Sculptor has been coughing blood... 

###23100803
I took a sample of this blood for my Dragonrot research.

###23100804
A sample of his blood?

###23100805
Yes. Blood that he's coughed up.

###23100806
The color of the blood itself appears to be tainted... stagnant...

###23100807
But... The sculptor's blood alone isn't enough to reach any conclusions...

###23100808
Is there anything I can do?

###23100809
...Yes... bring me samples of blood coughed up by others that suffer from the Dragonrot.

###23100810
If I have more, I'll be able to learn more about the disease.

###23100811
If I come across anyone afflicted by the dragonrot, I'll ask them.

###23100900###23110900
For my research...

###23100901###23110901
I need you to find me blood samples from others who are afflicted.

###23100902###23110902
I'll see what I can find.

###23101001
I'm glad you've come...

###23101100
I've been waiting for you.

###23101101
Any progress?

###23101102
Yes, I've found some answers.

###23101103
The source of the Dragonrot is the stagnation in your blood.

###23101104
What causes the stagnation?

###23101105
The blood has only a limited amount of power available to it. Let's say you've used all of this power...

###23101106
and then you attempt to resurrect again.

###23101107
The resurrection still occurs, but... It must draw on power from another source. 

###23101108
From those that have the Dragonrot?

###23101109
I believe so.

###23101110
For those who have the Dragonrot...

###23101111
The natural life force that everyone has, that allows them to live their lives and function as human beings, has been taken from them.

###23101112
Their blood has stagnated.

###23101113
Can it be cured?

###23101114
Yes, by giving back what has been taken.

###23101115
More precisely, giving them a portion of your resurrection power.
I will create a medicine based on that power.

###23101120
But right now, your blood is stagnated.

###23101121
So the first step is for you to suppress the stagnation of your blood.

###23101122
Otherwise, I cannot create the medicine.

###23101130
However, if your blood becomes stagnated...

###23101131
You'll need to find a way to suppress the stagnation.  

###23101200###23101300
I see you've managed to suppress the stagnation of the Dragon's Blood.

###23101201
But it appears that those afflicted with the Dragonrot are still sick.

###23101202
We must find a cure.

###23101301
So right now, your blood is in a normal state.

###23101302
If you'd like, I can create medicine for the Dragonrot.

###23101310
It seems you've suppressed the stagnation of the Dragon's Eye.

###23101400
It seems the Sculptor's Dragonrot has been cured.

###23101401
You had him take the medicine?

###23101403
Please, give this to him.

###23101405
It's his favorite "tea."

###23101406
I thought it would be a fitting way to celebrate his return to health.

###23101600
Oh, Master Wolf. I'm glad you've come.

###23101700
... You're here, Master Wolf.

###23101701
Was the sculptor able to help?

###23101702
Unfortunately, no...

###23101703
I'm afraid we'll need to look for other clues.

###23101800
So in order for the Purification to be possible...

###23101801
The oathbound of the Dragon's Heritage must lose their life...

###23101802###23111417
I don't want to lose Lord Kuro...

###23101803###23111418
Or you.

###23101804###23111419
But all paths are leading to dead ends...

###23101900
Master Owl's bell...

###23101901
There's no telling what it might reveal to you.

###23101902###23111615
So please, take care...

###23102000
You've come back from an old memory, I see.

###23102001
I have. But I haven't seen everything yet.

###23102002
I understand. Please, be careful...

###23102100
I have it.

###23102101
An Everblossom flower....

###23102102
Yes... there's no mistaking it.

###23102106
Something has happened, I see.

###23102107
...This will allow my lord to achieve Purification.

###23102109
I am merely doing what must be done.

###23102110
... I understand.

###23102111
I bid you good fortune in the battles to come.

###23102200
Master Wolf, you're here too.

###23102201
I've always enjoyed the sound of a Buddha being carved...
So I stop by this place every now and then.

###23102300
...I saw...

###23102302
...I saw you and Lord Kuro, in a vision.

###23102303
A vision...?

###23102310
...Where is Lord Kuro right now?

###23102311
He's being kept near the keep at Ashina Castle.

###23102312
The gate to the castle, however, is shut.

###23102321
Windows are often left open near the top of the castle...

###23102322
...I'll remember that.

###23102330
Hmm... for you to see such a thing--

###23102331
the bond of lord and retainer must be strong indeed.

###23102332
I would like to investigate these visions should the opportunity arise.

###23110000
You made this gourd?

###23110001
Yes. It was intended for Lord Kuro.

###23110002
But it seems he entrusted it to you.

###23110003
I'm sure you may have noticed, but...

###23110004
The medicinal waters in this gourd spring forth on their own.

###23110005
Even after being emptied you’ll find it full again, after a short rest.

###23110006
Yes.  Is there a way to improve it?

###23110007
Bring me Gourd Seeds.

###23110008
Gourd seeds...?

###23110010
Medicinal waters flow from gourd seeds.

###23110011
Adding new seeds will increase the volume of these medicinal waters.

###23110012
If you find any, bring them to me.

###23110013
All right..

###23110100
Is this a gourd seed?

###23110101
Yes. Bring it here.

###23110102
Plant the seed into the gourd.

###23110103
....... Perfect...

###23110104
Now the volume of medicinal waters in your gourd will increase.

###23110105
...... Such a strange medicine...

###23110106
Is it strange...?

###23110107
Hmmm... I don't take any offense to that.

###23110108
If it's effective then that's cause for celebration, whether it's strange or not.

###23110109
That's what my mentor Dogen taught me.

###23110111
Please bring me any other gourd seeds you find --

###23110112
I should be able to further increase the volume of the medicinal water.

###23110200
I'd like to make a request.

###23110206
This white mark... Is it a birthmark?

###23110208###23110301
Then... that must mean it appears on those who have received the Dragon's Heritage...

###23110209
Or perhaps... it's a symptom...?

###23110211
... Are you done?

###23110212
Yes, that will be all.

###23110213
I’m sorry... that was rather rude of me.

###23110214
That white mark around your right eye...

###23110215
Is it a birthmark?

###23110216
Or perhaps a symptom... of the Dragon's Eye...?

###23110300###23110310
So... it's not a birthmark...

###23110302
Or it could be... a symptom of the Dragon's Eye...

###23110400
I still don't understand the particulars, but... 

###23110401
It appears as though your body is no longer confined by the rules of our world.

###23110402
Come and see me if you notice anything alarming.

###23110501
Hmm... Notice anything different?

###23110503
Like what?

###23110504
I died... 

###23110505
The Divine Heir's voice reached out to me...

###23110506
And suddenly I was alive again.

###23110507
So you died... and now you're alive again.

###23110508
So that means it has to do with resurrection.

###23110509
Resurrection?

###23110511###23110601
It's said to be a power of the Divine Heir's Dragon Heritage.

###23110512###23110602
Those who have been given the power of resurrection - they are revived upon death.

###23110513###23110603
Repeatedly.

###23110514
......... Impossible.

###23110515
Yes. It is rather strange.

###23110516
And yet, it is happening here and now...

###23110517###23110604
Let me know if you notice any more changes.

###23110518###23110605
I don't think the power of resurrection comes without a cost.

###23110600
This power... it comes from Lord Kuro's...

###23110701
He said that repeated death causes the Dragon's Blood to stagnate.

###23110702
And stagnating past a certain point will cause the Dragon's Eye to overflow...

###23110703
You're showing symptoms of overflowing stagnation.

###23110704
That is my diagnosis.

###23110705
If you should notice anything alarming, come and see me.

###23110800
There must be a way to treat the Dragonrot.

###23110801
The first step is to look through my mentor's research and see if I can discover a way...

###23110802
The Dragonrot and the overflow of stagnation... There must be some link between the two.

###23111000
I've obtained one.  

###23111001
A blood sample. Let me see.

###23111002
...the coloration is very similar to the Sculptor's.
The color is just slightly tainted.

###23111003
But, what's this...? Hmm...

###23111004
Do you have enough blood?

###23111005
... I believe so.

###23111006
Allow me to continue my research into the Dragonrot.

###23111007###23111101
When we speak again, it's likely I'll have made a breakthrough.

###23111008###23111102
In fact, count on it.

###23111100
I can now continue my research on the Dragonrot with the blood sample you gave me. 

###23111200
Please make the medicine.

###23111201###24000511
Certainly.

###23111202
To do so, I need some of your power of resurrection.

###23111204
Here you are.  

###23111205
Dragonrot medicine.  It will suppress the effects of blood stagnation.

###23111300
There was a Dragonrot epidemic in Ashina once before.

###23111301
Back then, a cure was not achieved... every single person who caught it, died.

###23111303
Dogen, my late mentor, regretted this deeply.

###23111304
It is my hope that finally discovering the cure has alleviated this regret, if only a little.

###23111400
One of us must die.

###23111402
What did that mean?

###23111403
Were you listening this whole time?

###23111404###23111603###70001102
Tell me.

###23111405
......... I saw it.

###23111406
That day beneath the branches of the Everblossom tree...

###23111407
Lady Tomoe... tried to commit suicide...

###23111409
She said, 

###23111410
"Those made immortal by the Oath of the Dragon's Heritage shackle their masters"...

###23111411
So in order for the Purification to occur,

###23111412
The oathbound of the Dragon's Heritage must die?

###23111413
... Yes. Precisely.

###23111414
But, she was unable to achieve the Purification.

###23111415
Correct. She did not have the Mortal Blade.

###23111600
What are you hiding...?

###23111601
... So,

###23111602
You overheard.

###23111606
I will live by those words, as my master does.

###23111607
... Here.

###23111608
Is this a bell...?

###23111609
It fell off Owl's dead body, if I'm not mistaken.

###23111610
You and Master Owl have a deep connection...

###23111611
Should you offer it to Buddha, it may be a different experience than the one you had before.

###23111612
... I will try it.

###23111613
I am not sure what memories you will see...

###23111614
But the bell belonged to Master Owl.

###23111701
That is... unexpected.

###23111702
Did we not mean to celebrate the Sculptor's return to health?

###23111703
Please share it with him.

###23111801###23111901
Oh my...

###23111802
That is generous of you. I accept.

###23111803
Ahhh... Delicious.

###23111804
As a doctor, I do have other uses
for sake beyond just drinking.

###23111805
For purification?

###23111806
Yes.  It can also help those with a low tolerance for pain.

###23111807
But when I was a child, I couldn't stand the smell of it.

###23111808
You've been been doing medical work ever since you were a child?

###23111809
Yes. I wanted to be of use to my mentor... Master Dogen.

###23111810
I used to compete with my fellow disciples to treat patients.

###23111811
In those days, arrow and sword wounds were frightfully common. 

###23111815
It's nothing.

###23111816
Sometimes, shinobi would come for treatment as well.

###23111817
There was once... a rather difficult patient.

###23111818
Difficult in what way?

###23111819
He said very little.

###23111820
I didn't know where he was hurt or how much pain he was in...

###23111821
I had no information to go on.  It was maddening.

###23111823
... None of this sounds familiar to you?

###23111825
No, nothing.  Nothing at all.

###23111900
Here, for you.

###23111902
If this isn't... Lord Isshin's favorite sake.

###23111903
I'll have some!

###23111904
Ahh, Delicious.

###23111907
......... Please.

###23111909
Say... something.

###23111910
... There is something I'd like to ask you.

###23111912
Who trained you to fight with a blade?

###23111913
A blade...? I'm a doctor.

###23111914
Yes, but who?

###23111915
... Lord Isshin.

###23111916
But I only have a passing interest.

###23111917
I do not believe your skill counts... As a mere passing interest.

###23111918
Why did you learn?

###23111919
Well, not to kill people...

###23111920
...what do you mean?

###23111921
No... I don't have the slightest desire to kill anyone.

###23111922
It's just...I would want to kill a demon if one were to appear.

###23111923
A demon...?

###23111924
Don't take me seriously.

###23111925
It was only a joke...

###23112001
Oh, this is...

###23112002
This is Monkey Booze.

###23112004
Well, let me try it.

###23112005
Augh!  It... It burns so bad...

###23112006
Let's see... Yes, monkeys...
I seem to have a strong connection with monkeys.

###23112007
You do?

###23112008
Yes. I was rescued by a monkey after all.

###23112010
You don't believe me, do you?

###23112011
......... When I was young,

###23112012
I stood alone in the aftermath of a battlefield.

###23112013
I was alone, and staring dumbfounded.

###23112015
I could do nothing... neither cry nor even get angry.
Complete shock...

###23112016
And then there was a monkey... eating a rice ball.

###23112017
A monkey... maybe an ape...

###23112018
Maybe... either way, he made it look so delicious.

###23112019
I remember being angry at that.

###23112020
But then, then he gave me the rice ball.

###23112021
It tasted so good...

###23112022
What a kind monkey.  

###23112023
Yes. He was a very kind monkey.  

###23112100
Have some sake.

###23112101
Oh, is this Dragonspring?

###23112102
I'll have some.

###23112103
Ahh....

###23112104
......... Goodness.

###23112106
Nothing, it's just whenever Lord Isshin got his hands on Dragonspring...

###23112107
Everyone would start gathering at Ashina castle
and a rather rowdy party would ensue.

###23112108
Every time that happened, I'd leave Lord Dogen all on his lonesome,
and I'd stroll around the rear of the castle.

###23112109
Behind the castle? Why?

###23112110
......... Well...

###23112111
I'd go to the Fountainhead Spiral.

###23112112
What is that?

###23112113
If you look out toward the Fountainhead springs...

###23112114
there is a large spiral of clouds visible in the distance.

###23112115
Ligthning bolts would race from one cloud to the next.

###23112116
In fact... I distinctly recall Master Genichiro practicing his swordsmanship there

###23112117
All the while glaring at the lightning in those clouds...

###23120000###23120400
Goodbye.

###23120100
Good-bye...

###23120200
If you have an afflicted person drink this,

###23120201
their incessant wheezing and coughing should stop.

###23120202
...Understood.

###23120300
Oh...?  Did I hear the ringing of a chime?

###23120301
It was probably this bell.

###23120302
I was told to offer it to Buddha.

###23120303
Does the bell hold any significance for you?

###23120304
If it does, talk to the Sculptor.

###23120305
He is quite knowledgable when it comes to Buddha.

###23120500
Goodbye... Master Wolf.

###24000000
About the Divine Heir's life...

###24000002
There is something I wish to ask.

###24000003
Before that...

###24000004
Sake!

###24000006
You earned it. Take it!

###24000007
My grandson Genichiro was bewitched by the Rejuvenating Waters.

###24000008
You did well to put a stop to that for me.

###24000009
You have my thanks.

###24000010
I merely followed the code my father taught me.

###24000011
Ah, the Iron Code of the Shinobi...?

###24000012
I see... So you're the son of Owl.

###24000013
That boy he found during the rebellion.

###24000015
And your travels brought you here...

###24000016
The bonds that tie us are so deeply amusing!

###24000017
Don't you think... Sekiro?

###24000018
... You're...

###24000019
... So, what do you wish to know?

###24000100###24060200###24100013
Sekiro.

###24000101
What is it you wish to learn about severing the ties of immortality?

###24000200
Sekiro.  Is that the Mortal Blade?

###24000201
So what of the rumours?

###24000202
According to the Divine Child of the Inner Sanctum...

###24000203
Anyone who draws the Mortal Blade will meet death.

###24000204
Which means only one such as you can wield it, then?

###24000205
When I drew out the blade and saw its crimson edge...

###24000206
I, too, died once.

###24000207
.........I see. The crimson edge...

###24000208
Listen, Sekiro.

###24000209
With the Mortal Blade
you can now kill the undying.

###24000210
A truly terrifying weapon. Don't you think?

###24000211
... What are you trying to say?

###24000212
That sword is now yours.

###24000213###24000302
Who or what will you kill?

###24000214###24000303
You must be sure of the answer before drawing it.

###24000301
A weapon to kill the undying is now in your hands.

###24000400
The crimson Mortal Blade...

###24000401
That means the one that he has must be... black, then.

###24000402
...To abandon oneself in search of strength.

###24000403
... How tragic...

###24000500###24000600
Ah, Sekiro!

###24000501###24000601
Who are...

###24000502###24000602
Hmm? Ministry rats!

###24000503###24000603
They find a way in through every crack and crevice.

###24000504###24000604
There's always more of them to kill.

###24000505###24000605###24001100
... By the way, Sekiro.

###24000506###24000606###24001101
Have you mastered any secret techniques?

###24000508###24001103
Yes, it seems you have.

###24000509
Sekiro.
You really have a knack for killing.

###24000510
Wonderful!  Here's your reward.  Take it!

###24000512
Sekiro, I know you...

###24000514
Are...you alright?

###24000516
I'll enjoy the air up here for a little while longer.

###24000517###24000701
Go, Sekiro.

###24000527
Here's your reward. Take it!

###24000537
Have you mastered the Ways of the Ashina Blade?

###24000547
I entrust to you the secret technique of the Ashina Blade.

###24000609
Not quite yet, it seems.

###24000610
Cut them down, Sekiro. Every last one!

###24000800
You... 

###24000802
(laughs) Is that a look of concern on your face?

###24000803
Emma's always telling this old bastard to stay here.
So, that's why I'm here.

###24000804
By the way, Sekiro.

###24000805
It sounds like your battle to sever immortality with Kuro...
Is near a conclusion.

###24000806
You killed all those who... interfered?

###24000807
... I did.

###24000809
You did well to kill without hesitation.

###24000900
Don't forget, Sekiro.

###24000901
Hesitate, and you lose...

###24000902
That is the way of war.

###24001001
I'm concerned that the Tengu will make another appearance.

###24001004
I imagine Genichiro will show up eventually.

###24001005
To put it to use... The other Mortal Blade... 

###24001006
To protect Ashina...

###24001007
He'll abandon everything about who he is, won't he?

###24001008
Yes... I expect no less from my own grandchild.

###24001009
... However, I cannot let him use Kuro's blood.

###24001010
He can only swing the blade but a few more times...

###24001011
And when that happens, the Tengu will be no more.

###24001012
... But there is the other one.

###24001013
(cackle) You mean Sekiro?

###24001014
He is a sullen sort, but I can't say I detest the lad.

###24001015
In truth, he fascinates me.

###24001104
Here's your reward.  Take it.

###24010000
The Divine Heir's desire is to sever the ties of immortality.

###24010001
I want to know how it can be done.

###24010002
... The Mortal Blade.

###24010003
If you had such a weapon...
It may be the key to what you're after.

###24010005
With it, you could kill one who cannot die through normal means. 

###24010006
One who cannot die..?

###24010007
The infested...I believe they're called.

###24010008
I've not seen one before...

###24010009
But it's said you could stab them through the heart, or remove their head, and they wouldn't die.

###24010010
If the stories are true, they'd surely be quite fearsome... 

###24010012
To kill a monster such as that...
You'd need the Mortal Blade.

###24010101
It may be the key to what Kuro seeks; to severing immortal ties.

###24010102
With it, you could kill those who cannot die through normal means. 

###24010200
Where is this Mortal Blade?

###24010201
I've heard it's held in Senpou Temple.

###24010203###24010302
They say the Mortal Blade cannot be drawn.

###24010205
I'm not certain of the meaning. It's just hearsay.

###24010207
The gates to that temple are closed now, though.

###24010208
Who knows what those degenerates are doing shut away up there in the mountains...

###24010209
There aren't any decent roads leading there.

###24010210
How do I get there?

###24010211###24010304
The abandoned dungeon just outside of Ashina Castle.

###24010212
If you can pass through its waterways, you should find your way.

###24010303
There aren't any decent roads leading to the temple.

###24010305
If you can pass through its waterways, you should find your way there.

###24010401
Smart thinking, my boy!

###24010402
Let me see...

###24010403
That's some good sake!

###24010404
This is how we drank when we won our battles.

###24010405
The people of Ashina, together as one.

###24010406
Could you... tell me about the rebellion.

###24010407
Oh, the rebellion...

###24010408
We just took back what was stolen from us.

###24010410
Before, this land was... 

###24010411
It was a place where we, the Ashina people lived.

###24010412
Where the waters flowed, straight from the source.

###24010413
We were a people who loved our country dearly.

###24010414
And we made good sake to boot!

###24010415
... But we were heretics, and we were weak.

###24010416
Naturally, we were overrun. Trampled into submission.

###24010417
For many long, excruciating years...

###24010418
We couldn't even pray at the water from the springs...

###24010419
The way we were then...

###24010420
Even good sake couldn't get us truly drunk.

###24010421
... But then, the world fell into chaos.

###24010423
Amidst the chaos that was Japan... The endless casualties. The flames of war... 

###24010424
We found the perfect opportunity to take back our land.

###24010425
But now... It's a place of death...

###24010426
It's a bitter thing, indeed.

###24010501
Ahh, don't mind if I do!

###24010502
Ahhh... That's the stuff!

###24010503
By the way...

###24010504
How was Genichiro?

###24010505
What do you mean...?

###24010506
You two crossed blades, did you not?

###24010507
... To put it simply, he was strong.

###24010508
And he had... unusual techniques.

###24010510
What exactly is the Lightning of Tomoe...?

###24010511
That?

###24010512
It's a technique belonging to Genichiro's mentor.

###24010513
I'll wager it was quite the sight.

###24010514
His mentor...?

###24010515
Tomoe... There aren't many masters of the sword like her.

###24010516
To see her fight, it's like she is dancing.

###24010517
When you look into her eyes...

###24010518
You feel as if you're being drawn into the depths of the ocean.

###24010519
I was completely taken by her and it almost killed me... 

###24010520
I've lived a long life, but that was the closest I've come to death.

###24010600
Are you... Offering me the sake I gave you?

###24010601
Delightful, I'll take it!

###24010700
I have something for you.

###24010701
Ah, Sekiro! You know me well.

###24010702
Why, if this isn't monkey booze!

###24010703
Hahh! So this is what it's like to breathe fire!

###24010704
Do you know what other name this sake goes by?

###24010800
I don't.

###24010801
You don't?

###24010802
They call it Shura's Wine.

###24010900
Shura's Wine.

###24010901
That's right! You know your stuff.

###24010902
Don't tell me you've been treating someone else to this.

###24011000
I killed one once, long ago... 

###24011001
Shura... Or something very much like it.

###24011002
What is Shura, exactly?

###24011003
Those who go on killing will eventually become Shura.

###24011004
They don't even remember why... 

###24011005
Simply enraptured... They kill solely for the joy it brings them.

###24011100
I see it in your eyes, too. The shadow of Shura.

###24011102
Give me cause, and I will kill you.

###24011103
It would do you well to remember that.

###24011200
I saw it in your eyes, too. The shadow of Shura.
Or at least, I thought I did.

###24011202
However, it appears I was mistaken.

###24011203
If Shura were to appear, I would have cut it down myself.

###24011204
(laughs)

###24011301
Well Well!  If it isn't Dragonspring!

###24011302
You've really done it this time, Sekiro!

###24011303
Buhaah! That hit the spot!

###24011304
Whenever I used to get my hands on Dragonspring...

###24011305
Bunch of fools would start coming to me, demanding drinks.

###24011306
Fools...?

###24011307
Fools who wouldn't let go of their cross-spears while they drank... 

###24011308
Fools who would steal sake using illusion techniques...

###24011309
Fools tinkering with half-finished prosthetics, sake cup in hand.

###24011400###24011500
And even...

###24011401
The cunning owl, who despite his size would turn bright red after the first drop!

###24011403
Yes, your father was a fool too.

###24011501
The cunning owl, who despite his size would turn bright red after the first drop... 

###24011503
Yes, your father was a fool too...

###24011504
To the fools...

###24020000###24020100
You're leaving, Sekiro?

###24020001
Severing immortality... That will be quite the battle.

###24020002
And in battle...

###24020003
The plans and desires of those involved churn endlessly.

###24020004
If you hesitate you'll be swept away...

###24020005
...and lose the battle.

###24020006
That's right. Best you keep it in mind.

###24020007
Sekiro. Hesitate, and you lose.

###24060000
Shura... I never did think... 

###24060001
I'd have to kill your kind again!

###24060100
I'm not done, Sekiro!

###24060201
This is farewell...

###24060302
It was not... to be...

###24100000
Another rat.

###24100002
Ah, but those eyes...  a starving wolf.

###24100003
Before I kill you, tell me your name.

###24100004
Tell me your name!

###24100006
No name to give?

###24100007
You shinobi are all the same. You die nameless, with no one to mourn you.

###24100009
Your left arm. A prosthetic shinobi arm, it reminds me of...

###24100010
(Bursts out laughing)

###24100011
That's it... a one-armed Wolf.
I like it!

###24100014
This is what I shall name you.

###24100015
Who... are you?

###24100016
I am the Tengu of Ashina! 

###24100017
Come, Sekiro!

###24100018
Care to hunt some rats with me?

###24100020
Rats have snuck into Ashina.
Scurrying about like they own the place.

###24100021
There are all kinds of rats out there... 

###24100022
And they must be cut down. Every last one of them!

###24100023
It seems you have a talent for killing.
Allow me to help you hone that talent.

###24100024
What'll it be, Sekiro?! Will you hunt rats with me?

###24100100
What'll it be, Sekiro?

###24100101
Feel like hunting some rats now?  

###24100200
Oh! Looks like you've caught yourself some rats.

###24100202
I knew you had a talent for killing.

###24100203
Wonderful. Here's your reward. Take it!

###24100205
The ways of the Ashina blade!

###24100206###24100301
It's our school of fighting, but there are no hard and fast rules.

###24100207###24100302
You just win your battles. That alone is the most important rule of the Ashina style.

###24100208###24100303
I hope it can be of assistance with your rat hunting...
And most of all, your own battles you've yet to fight.

###24100300
About the ways of the Ashina blade...

###24110001
Excellent!

###24110002
You'll need this if you're with me, Sekiro.

###24110004
The face of a rat, and where it makes its home.

###24110005
Go and kill it!

###24110006
If you do, I will give you something that will aid you in battle.

###24110101
Not interested? That's a shame.

###24110102
Tell me if you come around.

###24160000
That... Shura...

###24160100
Sorry... I could not kill... him for you...

###24160300
The Ashina...

###24160400
Well done, Sekiroooooo!

###24160500
Cut me down!

###24160600###24260300
Do it!

###24160700###24260500
Take my head!

###24260000
Come... Sekiro.

###24260101
How my blood boils!

###24260102
Face me, Sekiro!

###24260200
Hesitation is defeat.

###24260201
I told you that, didn't I?

###24260400
Finish this!

###24260800
Well... done... Sekiro...

###24260900
......... Farewell.

###25000001
The... noble... fish...

###25000002
Master... I call it...

###25000003###25000101
Feed... it...

###25000004###25000102
The bell... must be... rung...

###25000100###25000200###25000300
Master...

###25000201
He will... be joyous...

###25000202
Happy... happy...

###25000203
He will be... rewarded...

###25000301
Must not... grow fat...

###25000302
In moderation... in moderation...

###25000400
Master, Master, Master...

###25000401
Master, where are you...

###25000402
Ohhhhh!

###25010000
Ahh... ahh... ahh...

###25010001
Master... Has passed... ohh...

###25010002
Oohhhhh...

###25010003
At last... at last...

###25010004
My duties... are complete...

###25010005
I am... grateful...

###25030000
Ohhh...

###25030100
Nnghh...

###25030300
Please... stop...

###25030400
Ungh...!

###25030401
Inexcusable...!

###25030500
Master... Master...

###25030501
Apologies... for the disturbance...

###25030600
Unnggghhhh...

###25030601
Ahhhhh...

###25030602
My duties... forgive me...

###26000000
I... I was "taken," you know.

###26000001
Rules... Ashina has rules... 
"Taken" gotta go to the Temple.

###26000002
All I really want
is go home, back to the village... 

###26000003
But if I cry--

###26000004
The Voice of Mother comforts me.

###26000005
Oh Mother...  
(sniff)... I'm so grateful... 

###26000100
Oh, it's you... Need something?

###26000200###26010501
They left me here...

###26000201
Where did everyone go?  Why did you leave Kotaro behind?

###26000202
Now what do I do...?   

###26000300###26000400###26001500
They left me all alone...

###26000301
And I have to find the "pure white flower".

###26000302###26000402###26001502
Where could it be...?

###26000401
The "pure white flower" flew away

###26000500
I see, the dungeon outside Ashina Castle.

###26000501###26011211
I'll go to the dungeon, just like you suggested.

###26000502###26010712###26011212
I mean... maybe I'll be able to meet my daddy.

###26000503###26010713###26011213
You really are a good man...

###26000600
The peddler, Anayama, right?

###26000601###26010805
All right, I'll do it.  I'll go and see.

###26000700
Please, can you spirit me away?

###26000701###26010913
I'm sure that everyone will be...wherever I disappear to.

###26000702###26010914
And then I'll get to see them!

###26000703###26010915
I'm in charge of looking after the children, after all.

###26000704###26010916
You can do that?  Right?

###26000800
Alright then. Okay.

###26000801
Go ahead and do it, right now!

###26000900
Uwaaagghh!

###26001000
Ahhh.........

###26001100
Umm... No, no, that's not true...

###26001101
That guy, I know he looks a little shifty...

###26001102
But... He's a good man!

###26001103
......Kotaro?

###26001104
Hm? Oh, it's you! I'm glad you made it

###26001105
Look, everyone! Mr. Shinobi is here too!

###26001106
Ahhh...! Children! Greet him properly!

###26001108
Hm? Ah, right... You can't see them, can you?

###26001109
The rejuvenated children...?

###26001110###26900500
Yes!

###26001111
You can't see them, but they're there

###26001112
They're adorable kids!

###26001113
Right then... I must give you my thanks.

###26001115
Thank you so, soooo much!

###26001200###31031301
Hehehe...

###26001202
The kids are saying thank you, too.

###26001203
They're so adorable!

###26001300###26100200
Ohh, Mr. Shinobi

###26001301###26001400###26100201###26100300
Anayama is a good man.

###26001302###26001401###26100202###26100301
He called me here to mourn those who died in battle.

###26001303###26001402###26100203###26100302
We take off the armor, cleanse the body, and make proper graves.

###26001304###26001403###26100204###26100303
Times as they are, decent burials don't happen as much as they should...

###26001501
And I have to find the "pure white flower"

###26010000
The monks in the Temple,
they're like me, you know.

###26010001
They was "taken," too.

###26010002
No one breaks the rules.
Everyone goes to the Temple.

###26010003
But really, everyone's scared.

###26010004
If we get "taken" again,
we'll disappear for good.

###26010005
I... 
(sniff)... I don't want to disappear.

###26010100
Ahhh, you too!

###26010101
You heard the Voice of Mother!?

###26010102
That slow, gloomy voice
could belong to only Her.

###26010103
Once I heard the Voice of Mother,
I stopped working for those monks.

###26010200
Say you became separated from the Bandit Peddler

###26010300
Reveal location of Bandit Peddler

###26010401
Everyone's gone, I'm all alone.

###26010402
Who's everyone?

###26010403
Everyone?  ... Huh? Who?

###26010404
Nnh... Ghh... Unhh...

###26010405
"The spinning, spinning, red and white flowers..."

###26010406
"Only one, pure white flower..."

###26010407
"The pure white flower I cannot find..."

###26010409
Nngh... My head...hurts...

###26010410
Sorry

###26010411
I have...no idea what I'm saying

###26010412
I just ... I've got to find the  "pure white flower"

###26010502
And I can't even find the flower...

###26010600
Is this what you're looking for?

###26010601
Uuh... That's a "red and white flower"

###26010602
I'm looking for a "pure white flower"

###26010604
But you... You're trying to help.

###26010605
Thank you... You're a good man.

###26010606
A pure white flower...

###26010607###26010802
Um... Um...

###26010608
Yes... It flew away...

###26010609
Yes, that's right
the "pure white flower" flew away

###26010700
Make your way to the abandoned dungeon of Ashina castle.

###26010701
Huh? Abandoned dungeon?

###26010703###26011203
.......My....

###26010704###26011204
My daddy... is there.

###26010706###26011206
Yeah, he did something bad.

###26010707###26011207
But he wasn't taken to a cell like you normally would.... Uh...

###26010708###26011208
They took him to a place that was damp... like a dirt cellar.

###26010710###26011210
........ Right!

###26010711
I'll go to the abandoned dungeon, just like you suggested.

###26010800
There's a peddler named Anayama near Ashina Castle looking for help.

###26010801
You should give him a hand.

###26010803
I mean, if everyone comes back, I won't be here but...

###26010804
I AM pretty lonely...

###26010806
You should.

###26010807
Hehehe.  You really are a good man.

###26010900
Is this the "pure white flower"?

###26010901
Ah... Ahhhhh...! That's...!

###26010902
Ohhhh... I remember now...

###26010903
Everyone... They are children of the rejuvenating waters...

###26010904
And... I remember I tried to find a pure white pinwheel?

###26010905
A pinwheel... for that child...

###26010906
...Hey, can I ask a favor?

###26010908
Could you spirit me away?

###26010909
I don't follow.

###26010910
I know about you. You're a shinobi, right?

###26010911
Those monks say... Shinobi can spirit people away... make them disappear as if they were never there.

###26010912
Why do you want that?

###26011001
Ohhh... Thank you! Thank you!

###26011002
I'm ready.  But also a little frightened...

###26011003
But yes, do it!

###26011102
If you change your mind, please...tell me.

###26011200
Make your way to the abandoned dungeon of Ashina Castle.

###26011201
Huh? The dungeon?

###26020000
G-goodbye... 

###26030000###43030000###46030000
Wah!

###26030100
Gyah!

###26030200
Stop it, please!

###26030400###30100000###30100400###30110301###30130200###31031401
Ahh...

###26030500
Ohh...

###26030700
You're... bad!!

###26030800###26030900
Gyaaah...

###26030801
So... mean...

###26030901
D-... Daddy...

###26031000
Daddyyyy!

###26031100
Don't! Anayama is a good man!

###26031200
Oooh.... You said they'd be here...!

###26100000
After meeting with Bandit Peddler.
Expresses gratitude for revealing the location
of the Bandit Peddler

###26100100
After surviving Tokugawa raid.
Grief-striken from the attack

###26200000
(groan)

###26200100
(Groan... groan...)

###26900000
(Sickly labored wheezing)

###26900003
Guys...

###26900004###26900103
Don't... don't go... Not without me...

###26900101###26900301###26900402
So you've caught it too, Kotaro...

###26900102
(Wheeze...) Guys...

###26900202
Anayama...

###26900203###26900303###26900404
I've gotta... gotta help...

###26900302###26900403
(Wheeze...) Anayama...

###26900502###26900702
Thank you kindly.

###26900600
Mr Shinobi, we have a huge problem...

###26900601
Mr. Anayama.... He's... he's...!

###26900602
W-what should I do?

###26900603
Ohhh... Mr. Anayamaaa!

###26900700
Take a look, come on. Anayama, see?

###26900701
He's all better now... I'm so glad...

###26900703
You... really are, a really, really good man.

###26900705
I know! Here's something to show you my gratitude.

###26900706
Take it, come on.

###26900707
No need...

###26900708
You must accept it! I won't take no for an answer!

###26910001###44900002
(Wheeze... wheeze...)

###26910002
It's... It's you...

###26910003
Drink this. It's medicine.

###26910004
Sure...

###26910005
(Gulp)

###26910006###30910002
(SIgh of relief...)

###26910007
Do you... feel better now?

###26910008
Yeah...

###26910009
Why, are...

###26910010
You... such a good... man...?

###26910102
Every... one...

###26910202
Mr... Anayama...

###26910300
I'm taking a sample of your blood.

###26910302
... need to bring this to Lady Emma.

###27000000
Basket, basket, basket, basket, basket...

###27000001
I... am a basket...

###27000100
Hey you... you got something on your mind?

###27000101
Look, sorry but...
If you have questions I'll have to keep this basket on while I answer.

###27010000###30010000
Hey.

###27010001
(Wails in fear)

###27010002
Basket, basket, basket, basket... Aaahhhh...

###27010003###27010104
Calm down.

###27010004###27010105
......Y-You...
Are you an honorable person?

###27010006###27010107
Thank goodness...!

###27010007###27010108
You ARE an honorable person.

###27010008
(Sobs)

###27010009###27010110
Is there...something you want to ask?

###27010010###27010111
Look, sorry but...
If you have questions I'll have to answer with this basket on my head.

###27010101
Basket, basket, basket... Hmm?

###27010102
Someone's...there!

###27010103
Ahhhhh!

###27010109
(sobs in relief)

###27010200
What is wrong with this village?

###27010201
I'd sure like to know that too.

###27010202
Before I knew it...everyone had gone insane!

###27010203
For awhile I too was in a daze, but...

###27010204
I snapped out of it after I hurk-hurk... threw up.

###27010205
...........

###27010206
I was thirsty so I drank a loooot of sake.

###27010207
I'm sure that's what made me throw up.

###27010208
The head priest sometimes treats us to sake.

###27010209
But you know... when you drink sake, you get thirsty.

###27010210
The sake cask runs dry in no time.

###27010211
So everyone has no choice but to drink the water in the ponds and rivers

###27010212
But, the more you drink it, the thirstier you get...

###27010213
Ah... You get thirstier and thirstier, can't ever drink enough...

###27010300
What is wrong with the villagers?

###27010301
...Hmm, no idea.

###27010302
All I know is, they all fear fire.

###27010303
For awhile, I too was in the same daze.  And I felt the fear too.

###27010304
An unquenchable fire... Even now, the thought of it gives me chills!

###27010305
An unquenchable fire...

###27010306
The hunter Inuhiko
started burning pine resin and locked himself in his house.

###27010307
His pine resin burns a long time...
It's a real nuisance.

###27010308
Inuhiko is the village outcast.
He likes eating wild animal meat and the sort...

###27010309
That's why the head priest doesn't give him any sake.

###27010310
Where is Inuhiko's house?

###27010311
Oh, on the other side of the pond.
Inuhiko's is the last house on the path.

###27010400
Tell me about the priest.

###27010401
He's the most important person in the entire village.

###27010402
You can find him in the shrine, all the way up the riverside
near the water's source.

###27010403
He told us,

###27010404
"Let us become citizens of the palace."

###27010405
"If you drink enough sake, you shall become citizens," he said!

###27010407
A "citizen of the palace"... I don't really get it, but that's what he said!

###27020000
Got to go, huh?

###27020001
I'll be here, hiding in this basket.

###27020002
...must... resist... drinking...

###27030200
Please, stop!

###27030300
What're you doing?!

###27030400
No, must resist drinking...

###27030401
...but I don't ... have a choice..

###27030600
Gotta... get outta... the basket...

###27030700
You... monster...

###27130000
I couldn't... resist...

###27130001
I drank it all...!

###27900003
Why are you... staring at me...?

###27900004###27900104
This would... never've happened if I'd stayed... in the basket!

###27900103
(wheeze) Why are you... staring at me...?

###27900500
I dunno how it worked, but...

###27900501
I think I'm all better.

###27900502
Of course, I can't assume I'm better yet -- otherwise my throat'll act up again.

###27900503
Gotta resist...

###27910001###29910001
(Nngh... Gulp...)

###27910003
This will make you feel better.

###27910005
(...gulp) Oh, right...

Speak to_Incoherent muttering through the door

###28000600###28000700###28000800###28010001###28010010###28010101
Gulp... Gulp... Gulp

###28000601
Ahhh... Let's see now... 

###28000602
Yes... I can feel it... Dissolving... Liquefying... 

###28000603
Ooohhhhh...

###28000801
Gulp... Gulp...

###28000802
Ohh... The cup has run dry... 

###28000803###28000902
But this won't do... It's too dilute...refuses to dissolve completely... 

###28000804###28000903
Unfit to be citizens of the palace... Oohhh... 

###28000805###28000904
Ohh... Waters of the palace... Fill our cups once more... 

###28000806###28000905
Fill them to the brim... To the brim... 

###28000900
(Slurping)

###28000901
... Ohh... The cup has run dry... 

###28001000
(Licking the pot)

###28001001
Ohh... Please, please... Accept us as your humble servants.

###28001100###28010208###28010209
(Gulping)

###28010002
Hey, what are you doing?

###28010003
Ahhh... It feels... 

###28010004
Ohh... That's good... It's melting inside... 

###28010005
But it's not enough... Keep pouring... Pour until it brims... 

###28010006
Come forth, my people!

###28010007
Come forth and drink, drink! Indulge yourselves in the sweet nectar!

###28010008
Come forth... As citizens of the palace... One and all... 

###28010009
Aahh... Please, accept us...as your humble servants... 

###28010200
Hello...

###28010201
...Hmm?

###28010203
Ooohh... This fragrance... Such an esteemed aroma... 

###28010204
Finally, we may be accepted... We may serve as their humble servants... 

###28010205
... At last... At long last... 

###28010206
You... Let me give you this.

###28010207
 In that case, you will surrender it to me!

###28010301
 Oohh... For now we rest... But not yet fully liquefied... 

###28030300
What...

###28030401
Please... Accept us... Aahhh... 

###29000000###29000900###29001000###29900200
Thank heavens... Thank heavens...

###29000001
For what do you pray?

###29000002
Hmm?  You there... have you heard of the Senpou Temple?

###29000003###29001001
The Senpou Temple on Mount Kongo...

###29000004###29001002
A very special, holy person lives in that place.

###29000005###29001003
Go on, join me in prayer.

###29000006###29001004
Thank heavens, thank heavens....

###29000200
Did you meet with the Divine Child of the rejuvenating waters?

###29000202
Ohh, ohh, ohh... I am glad to hear it.

###29000203
Has the Divine Child been properly eating her fruit?

###29000204###29000301
She should have one... No, no, two...

###29000205###29000302
Anyway, she should make sure to eat a lot of them.

###29000300
Has the Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters...
been properly eating her fruit?

###29000400###29000500###29000600
Ah, fruits of the serpent, yes... There are two kinds.

###29000401###29000501###29000601
One is fresh.

###29000402###29000502###29000602
The other is dried.

###29000403###29000904
It's over there.

###29000404
The fresh one is over there.

###29000405
Over the cliff, through the hole...

###29000406###29000506
That's where you'll find it.

###29000407
... fresh?  What are you talking about?

###29000408###29030501
Heh?  Something troubling you?

###29000409###29030502
Rice for me, that's the way.

###29000410###29030503
Rice, I say!

###29000411
If something troubles your mind--

###29000412###29030505
Bless me with rice, any time!

###29000503###29200004
Over there.

###29000504
The dried fruit is over there.

###29000505
Past the poison swamp, down the nest...

###29000603
The bottom...

###29000604
The dried fruit is at the bottom.

###29000605
If you climb down to the bottom of the valley, past the poison swamp...

###29000606
That's where you'll find it!

###29000700
The fresh and dried fruits -- did she eat them?

###29000702
Ohh, ohh, ohhh... Then all is well...

###29000703
Divine Children...

###29000704
May you be safe on your long journey...

###29000705
Over...there... 

###29000800
Thank heavens... thank heavens...

###29000801###29000901
Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters... thank you.

###29000802
Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters...?  What are you talking about?

###29000803
Heh?  You, you wish to meet the Divine Child?

###29000804
That way--

###29000805###29000905
Senpou Temple is that way.

###29000806###29000906
Pass through the abandoned dungeon, swim the cold waters...

###29000807###29000907
that will take you right to the Senpou Temple on Mt. Kongo.

###29000903
You wanted to meet with the Divine Child, I recall?

###29001100
That's right, yes that's the way... That's how one prays.

###29001101
You have a pious temperament. I offer this to you.

###29001200
Yes, yes... Pray as much as you please.

###29001201
Such a good, pious temperament. I offer this to you.

###29001300###29001400
Yes, very good... What devotion.

###29001301
Lastly, I offer this to you.

###29001302###29001401
If only someone like you could stand with the Divine Child...

###29001303###29001402
Those monk scoundrels... always chase me away...

###29001304###29001403
Oh, Divine Child...

###29010000
... here's some rice.

###29010001
Ohhh, ohhh there's no doubt... this is the Divine Child's rice!

###29010002
Oh thank heavens, thank heavens...

###29010003
Tell me, what do you see?

###29010004
Mmm...

###29010005###29010205
(munch, munch, munch, munch)

###29010006
Ahhhh.... (murmuring in sleep)

###29010007
"If it's fresh fruit you want, fly a kite..."

###29010008###29010012
"Wind the puppet... fly a kite!..."

###29010010
(sleepy murmurs)... delicious...

###29010011
"If it's fresh fruit  you want, fly a kite..."

###29010013
Hmm... wind the puppet?  Not sure what she's talking about...

###29010020
Hmm... could she mean I need to control someone to make them fly a kite?

###29010101
Have any rice?

###29010102
Rice from the divine child!

###29010110
Yaaaa!

###29010111
To eat fresh fruit... Fly a kite!

###29010112
Wind the puppet! Fly a kite!

###29010200
...here's some rice.

###29010201
Ohhh, ohhh there's no doubt...this is the Divine Child's rice!

###29010202
Oh, thank heavens, thank heavens.

###29010203
Tell me what you see.

###29010206###29010210
"If it's dried fruit you're after... become a trainer of monkeys..."

###29010207
"make the monkey dance... and he'll be eaten!..."

###29010209
(murmuring in sleep)... so sweet...

###29010211
"make the monkey dance and he'll be eaten..."

###29010212
Hmm.. Make a monkey dance?  What does it mean?

###29010220
Hmm... is she saying I need to control someone and have them be eaten by something...?

###29010300
...Yaaaaaaa!!!

###29010301
If it's dried fruit you want, you need the monkey!

###29010302
Make the monkey dance!!  Let him be eateennnn!!!

###29030000###29030400###31030900###46030100
    

###29030200
Please stop...

###29030401###29910102
Divine... Child...

###29030500
What are you talking about?  Dried fruit?

###29030504
If something's---- not right---

###29060000
Thank heavens... Thank heavens... Ohh, thank heavens...

###29200000
Will you be cast out?  Or throw yourself in?

###29200002
If you wish to go to the very depths of Ashina...

###29200003
Then you'd best cast yourself out.

###29200005
The depths of Ashina are over there.

###29900002
Divine... Child... 

###29900004###29900104
Don't... force yourself to speak...

###29900005
Argh...

###29900006###29900106
I...don't know...

###29900007
Which... way...

###29900101
You have the Dragonrot.

###29900102
(wheeze) Divine... Heir... (wheeze)

###29900105
(wheezing) Argh...

###29900107
(wheeze) Which... way...

###29900201
You... I'm so very grateful for what you did.

###29900300
Thank... you... Thank... you...

###29900301
I'm so... so very grateful... 

###29910006
Hm?

###29910007
Thank... heavens... Thank... heavens...

###30000001
It truly...stirs my soul...

###30000002
Beautiful... And yet, somehow sad...
As if it yearns, it calls for someone...

###30000100
(Coughs) ... Shinobi... have you ever heard--

###30000101
someone playing the shamisen around here?

###30000102###30000201
I followed the sound
and it led me to this well.

###30000200
Shinobi, have you heard the shamisen yet?

###30000300
You said you heard the melody in the abandoned dungeon, did you not?

###30000301
It's my job to look into anything out of the ordinary.

###30000302
I'll stop by there when I have the time.

###30000303###30010308
I will look into this should I find a free moment.

###30000400###30000500
Why...

###30000401###30000501
Why can't I hear... the melody...?

###30000502
Wait... was it you?  You did this...?

###30000503
The melody.... Give it back!!

###30000504
Give it back to me!

###30010001
Who are you calling for...?  Let me hear it one more time...

###30010002
Hey, you.

###30010004
(Coughing)

###30010005
My name is Jinzaemon Kumano.
My duty is to patrol the moat.

###30010007
I've not seen you around before. Which clan are you?

###30010008
...I cannot say.

###30010009
You cannot say...you say?

###30010010
Hmm... So you are a shinobi, then?

###30010011
I cannot say.

###30010012
...your manners could use some work.

###30010013
No matter. If you're a shinobi,
I won't press any further.

###30010101
Mmm... Please...

###30010102
Who are you calling for...? Let me hear it one more time...

###30010200
I have not.

###30010201
Is...that so.

###30010202
I thought since you're a shinobi you might know...

###30010203
Hmm... I wonder who that melody calls to...?

###30010204
I don't know why, but I can't stop thinking about it.

###30010206
Ah!

###30010207
No... It's nothing.

###30010208
Please forget I ever spoke of it.

###30010300###30210300
Try the abandoned dungeon.

###30010301
You believe it came from there?

###30010303
I have heard that the well is connected to that dungeon...

###30010304
If I were to follow it, I just might find the one playing that melody...

###30010305
I'm sorry, I'm being rude...I lost my composure.

###30010306
Hmm... The abandoned dungeon, you say...?

###30010307
It is my job to investigate anything suspicious.

###30030200
Ugh, would you stop that?!

###30030300
Guh... Shinobi, what are you doing?!

###30030400
I don't want to kill you...

###30030401
But you persist!

###30030501
I will mourn your passing...

###30030602
Why... would you..

###30100001
She's gone...

###30100002
But she was here just moments ago!

###30100100
(sniffs) Now that I think it over...

###30100101
My father told me stories about a hidden town shrouded deeply in mist.

###30100102
An ominous town...

###30100103
Don't ever go there... he said.

###30100104
.........But, that doesn't matter to me now.

###30100105
Now, there's a thick, misty forest in my way.

###30100106
If I could only figure out how to get through it and find that shamisen player...

###30100200
Much obliged.

###30100201
I will visit the dungeon
as you have so kindly suggested.

###30100300
Urhh... Is that you, Shinobi...?

###30100301
I was so taken by the melody, I did not see you coming.

###30100302
Ahhh... I can hear it.

###30100303
I am sure the shamisen player is just beyond here...

###30100304###30100401
I knew it... She's been waiting for me the whole time...

###30100500
Is that you? Are you there... Shinobi...?

###30100502
I must give you my thanks, Shinobi.

###30100503
Your thanks?

###30100504
You brought the shamisen player to me.

###30100505
Just a moment ago... she caressed me...
While playing her sweet melody.

###30100507
It was a different song than before.
Like a lullaby... A peaceful, warm...melody.

###30100508
She spoke to me as she played

###30100509
"Thank you for coming to me," she said.

###30100510
It turns out she WAS calling to me this whole time.

###30100511
Shinobi...please...take this.

###30100512
I'm... So very tired now...

###30110001
...Hm? Ahh, Shinobi...

###30110002
Listen!
I finally saw her.

###30110003
The shamisen player... was a woman.

###30110004
I only saw her from afar... But I could tell... A beautiful, yet fleeting presence...

###30110005
Ahh... I should've asked if she was calling to me!

###30110006
And before I knew it she'd disappeared into the mist.

###30110101
Ahh... Me...? Was she calling me?

###30110200
Why don't you try the abandoned dungeon again?

###30110201
I see... the old dungeon huh?

###30110202###30110402
Yes, it might be connected to the source of the melody....

###30110203###30110403
If this person can help me reach the shamisen player,
maybe I should pay them a visit...

###30110302
It's coming from deep in the fog... that melody is calling me.

###30110400
Try returning to the abandoned dungeon.

###30110401
I see... the abandoned dungeon huh?

###30130001
You are jealous 'cause cannot hear the melody, are you not?!

###30130100
Haah... He really had no...

###30130101
...no appreciation for her beauty!

###30130201
I can hear it... She's... calling...me...

###30200001
It's faint but... Yes, I can hear it...

###30200002
As if it is......calling out for someone, crying...

###30200003
Perhaps it is calling to...me?

###30200100
I must follow it.

###30200101
That melody... I am sure it calls me...

###30200102
How might I pursue it...?
Shinobi, what do you think?

###30200200
If I go to the abandoned dungeon, I can pursue the melody...

###30200201
I can find out who it's calling for...

###30200300
Ghh... Gwaahhh...

###30200400
Ahhh... Ooh-gwahh...

###30200500
(Sickly groaning)

###30200600
(Sickly groans)

###30210001
Every now and then...yes... I can hear it.

###30210002
Give me a sign... Is it me you're calling to...?

###30210004
Hmm? Ah, if it isn't the Shinobi.

###30210005
Following the sound brought me here.

###30210006
Can you hear it? It's faint... Carried by the wind...

###30210007
It's coming from this hole.  You hear it, do you not?

###30210008
I hear nothing.

###30210009
.........I see.  Perhaps I alone can hear it?

###30210010
Ah... Nothing else matters... I must follow that melody.

###30210011
That melody calls to me.
At least... I believe it does.

###30210101
Here and there...yes... I can hear it.

###30210200
Don't know.

###30210201
...Is that so...

###30210202
Then please, leave me alone.

###30210203
I'd like to listen to it on my own.

###30210301
The dungeon?

###30210302
Well, if the melody is coming from the bottom of this hole...

###30210304
Yes, the dungeon could be the way...  I see.

###30210305
You have my deepest thanks!

###30210306
I just might find a way to reach the source from the dungeon...

###30900001
Hey... what's wrong?

###30900002
 Sh... shinobi... 

###30900003
(Deep labored wheezing)

###30900004###30900104
Don't force yourself to speak.

###30900005###30900105
Right...

###30900006
I must follow... follow the... melody...

###30900007
The melody... it... calls to me...

###30900008
(Humming and wheezing)

###30900009###30900109
I can... I can hear it... but...

###30900101
Jinzaemon... You too?

###30900102
 Sh... shinobi... (Wheeze!)

###30900103
(Wheeze, wheeze, wheeze...!)

###30900106
(Wheeze...) I must follow... (Wheeze....) follow the... melody...

###30900107
(Wheeze...) The melody... (Wheeze...) it... calls to me...

###30900200
I can breathe easier now that the sickness is gone.

###30900201
It's all thanks... to the medicine you gave me...

###30900202
Truly, you have my gratitude.

###30900301
Truly... you have my... my gratitude...

###30910004
(Pant... pant... pant...)

###30910005
...Shinobi...

###30910006
Maybe now... I can pursue it...

###30910008
You have... my gratitude... Shinobi...

###30910009
No... No need to thank me...

###30910101
(Labored wheezing)

###30910102
Ahh... I can... hear it...

###31001000
What...are you doing here? Of all places?

###31001002
...Ah.

###31001003
Are you, perhaps, a shinobi?

###31001100
My dear Shinobi...

###31001101
The details are in the document I gave you.

###31001102
Considering the nature of the information, I think you'd agree that the less we know about each other, the better. 

###31001200
My dear Shinobi,

###31001201
I thank you for dutifully completing your task.

###31001202
At this moment, the person in question is in the surgery facility of the abandoned dungeon.

###31001203
Our trials can now move forward...
I'm sure the master will be pleased.

###31001204
I offer this as my thanks.   Please, take it.

###31001300
It's about time I embark for the facility as well...

###31001301
You have performed your role most admirably.

###31001302
My master and I now have work we must complete.

H-How is this, Master Dousaku?

###31001401
If we were to use a strong, well trained samurai like him...

###31001402
If we were to use a long-serving, war-tattered shinobi like him...

###31001403
........ Yes, it should work.

###31001404
Begin preparations.

###31001405
Yes sir...

###31001406
Preparing the rejuvenating water.

###31001407
For the glory of Ashina.

###31001408
We begin, my apprentice!

###31001409
Yes, Master Dousaku...

###31001410
Our subject is of large stature and possesses near super-human strength.  This inspires confidence...

###31001500
How is the progress, Master Dousaku?

###31001501
...Doujun!

###31001502
.........Hm? (whispering) Ah... of course.

###31001503
(whispering)  Master... I'll be sure to give clear, detailed instructions.

###31001504
My dear Shinobi... This is not proper.

###31001505
You cannot simply enter this facility as you please, without notification. 

###31001506
Please take your leave.

###31001600
(Groaning)

###31001601
...it's not human... not anymore...  

###31001602
Ahem. 

###31001603
Ah... My dear shinobi...

###31001605
...it's nothing.

###31001606
...For you.  From the master.

###31001607
We request your assistance once again.

###31001700
The details are in the document...

###31001701
If it could be obtained.... We believe it could further improve our treatment.

###31001800
Ahh... My dear Shinobi

###31001801
Did you...bring what we requested?

###31001900
With this, we can advance the treatment even further...

###31001901
Master, I'll bring it immediately...

###31002000
Unh... Aahhh...

###31002001
Master Dousaku... What on earth...

###31002002
What?...Surely you don't  intend to use that on me?

###31002003
Very astute, my apprentice.

###31002004
You are the next subject.

###31002005
P-Please, no!

###31002006
As I feared... You have strayed from the path of medicine.

###31002007
Why would you do such a thing?

###31002009
No, master... The rejuvenating waters have bewitched you.

###31002011
Master... Please answer me...!

###31002013###31002100
Please answer me, master!

###31002014###31002101
Why?! Why won't you answer me?! Answer me, Dousaku!!

###31002015
Dousakuuuuuuuuu!!

###31002200
Answer me, Dousaku...

###31002201
Master... Why... Why won't you answer me...?

###31002202
Dousaku... Dousaku... Dousaku...

###31010001
I thought as much.

###31010002
Might you be willing to take on... a favor for me?

###31010003
I am Doujun.
I've been tasked with the preparation of a medical treatment using the rejuvenating waters.

###31010004
I'll get to the point, my dear Shinobi...

###31010005
This is a letter I received from the master. 

###31010006
The particulars are contained within.

###31010101
My, you are a talkative one, aren't you? 

###31010102
In that case, I don't wish to waste any more of your time. Good day.

###31010201
Indeed... you have obtained it.

###31010202
With this, the treatment can be advanced.

###31010203
I'm sure the master...will be ecstatic.

###31010204
...even if, I am not.

###31010205
Try as I might, I'm unable to muster the same level of enthusiasm...

###31010206
Doujun, you novice...

###31010208
Ah... Fret not, dear shinobi.
I will perform my duty.

###31010209###33160500
For the glory of Ashina...

###31010210
Your reward, dear shinobi.
Please accept it with our thanks.

###31010302
Ahh...forgive me. I must get back to work.

###31031000
P-Please stop

###31031100
What are you doing...?!

###31031201
Why?!

###31031202
So, you cannot abide our science?!

###31031302
Master, I've done as you've asked.

###31031400
Ahhhhhh...!

###31031402
Master... Please, help me...

###31031500
I've done it...

###31031501
Everything will be fine as long as I obey master...

###31031600
Gwahhh...!

###31031601
Ahh... I am sorry.

###31031602
Master... I've failed you...

###31031700
Master!

###31031701
I, Doujun, have finally succeeded!

###31900501
So this... this is how you toy with me...

###31900502
What do you have planned next, Dosaku...?

###31910000
Take this... It's medicine.

###31910001
Medicine...?

###31910002
My dear shinobi...

###31910003
I'm not... that foolish...

It's medicine for the Dragonrot...

A doctor named Emma made it

###31910202
Emma...!

###31910203
She's but a child...! How ridiculous...

###31910204

I suppose I could... try it.

What business do you have with Senpou Temple?

###32000300
Is there...something else?

This temple...
it's no longer a place where decent people should be.

###32000302
... Hm?

###32000303
That smell...

###32000304
So you're the one who works for the Divine Heir of the Dragon's Blood.

###32000306
The Divine Heir is truly exalted...

###32000307
But exalted or not... man is still man...

###32000308
Ohhh... I'm so foolish that... I didn't understand that myself...

###32000309
Don't... Don't leave your Divine Heir on his own.

###32000310
Leave... It's too late to regret once you've already lost them...

###32000400
Make your way to Ashina Castle.

###32010000
I'm told that a special holy person lives here.

###32010001
Remarkably holy... That would be the child, I imagine.

###32010002
She's not here anymore.

###32010003
It's my fault... The child, she's confined within the Inner Sanctum.

###32010004
It's impossible to see her now...

###32010006
Are you... a shinobi?

###32010008
Hmm... If that's the case, then actually...

###32010009
I have a favor to ask of you.

###32010010
The child wanted to know... the reason for her fate.

###32010011
If you do see her by some chance, please give her this...

###32010012
It's the least I can do for my own atonement...

###32010101
You have no answer?

###32010102
Then you should leave.

###32030200
I must... return the child to her home...

###32030300
She must be so lonely... so lonely...

###33060000
You face... Genichiro Ashina...

###33060100
Prepare yourself!

###33060200
I ... will not be defeated... I cannot!

###33060300
Im... impossible...

###33065000
I will restore Ashina to glory!

###33065100
Though I abandon my humanity...

###33065101
I will never yield this!

###33065200
I will not allow Ashina to be crushed...!

###33065300
Yes, that's it.  Your strength...

###33065400
Do what... must be done...

###33065401
We're not so different, you and I.

###33065500
I too have a duty that I must uphold.

###33065501
... Farewell.

###33065600
I have... failed?

###33160000
Face me...

###33160001
Shinobi, I didn't think I'd see you again.

###33160100
I'm not finished yet... Shinobi of the Divine Heir...!

###33160200
The power of the Dragon's Blood?

###33160201
Then I will kill you as many times as it takes.

###33160300
I will take him back...

###33160301
You still stand...?

###33160302
What drives you to serve him...?

###33160400
Why won't you break...?

###33160600

###34060001
...Why indeed?

###34060002
You'll die if you doubt yourself, boy.

###34060100
Hehehe... impressive, boy.

###34060101
In that case...

###34060102
Lose yourself in my illusions.

###34060200
Now we're having fun, boy...

###34060300
You're surprisingly skilled, son of Owl.

###34060400
Oh, don't mind me.  I'll be watching from up here.

###34060500
A wolf?  Hardly. 

###34060501
You were still just a puppy.

###34060600
You brat... how...

###34060700
That was... impressive...

###34060800
You've... gotten stronger... Wolf...

###34060900
I guess... it is my... time...

###34061300
You've... gotten stronger... wolf... 

###35030300
Move in haste and die, brat.

###35060000
My name... is Gyoubu Masataka Oniwa!

###35060001
As I breathe, you will not pass the castle gate!

###35060002
So that's Gyoubu the Demon.

###35060100
Boy, allow me to show you the wrath of a man...

###35060101
...who stood with the Ashina when they took this country!

###35060300
Oh ho, you're still standing?

###35060301
I'll strike you as many times as it takes...

###35060400
Still you stand?

###35060401
Genichiro has many burdens...

###35060402
And I consider you one of them.

###35060500
You will not take this Gyoubu's head!

###35060600
The castle gate remains closed.

###35060601
My work here is done.  

###35060700
Forgive me...!

###36000002###36100002
Bring them to me, and I'll reward you handsomely.

###36000100###36100100
Did you bring me any scales?

###36000101###36100101
If you have any, I'll reward you handsomely.

###36000201
I want to become a carp.

###36000202
A giant carp that will continue growing, and live a long, long life.

###36000203
A carp that never grows old...

###36000300
You have the aroma of the divine realm...

###36000301
And you've been so kind to me...

###36000302
Very well! I give this to you now.

###36000303
Bring it to the Great Carp of the divine realm...

###36000304
Then, I will finally become a carp...

###36000305
and bestow upon you my secret treasure.

###36000400
You still have my bait, do you not?

###36000401
Bring it to the Great Carp of the divine realm.

###36000402
Do that, and I'll bestow upon you my secret treasure.

###36000403###36020201
I'm waiting, waiting, waiting...

###36000404
I'm used to waiting at this point.

###36000405###36020202
Hehee, Heheeeheeehee!

###36000500
The damned fools at Fountainhead Palace...

###36000501
Soon, I'll be a carp.

###36000502
And as age withers you away, as you sit powerless in the face of eternity...

###36000503
I'll be the new Great Carp.

###36000504
Hehee, Heheeheehee!

###36000505
Heeheeheeheehee!

###36000601###36000700###36020401###36100801###36100900###36120401

###36000701###36100901
More... More...

###36020000
I thank you for your kindness.

###36020001###36120001
Please bring more scales soon.

###36020100###36120100
Bring me some scales next time...

###36020200
Don't forget to use the bait.

###36020300
Ooh, scales... More scales!

###36030000
Ahh!

###36030200
Quit it!

###36030300
Stop!  You'll break the pot!

###36030410
I'm going to be... a carp...

###36030710
I will grow... eternally...

###36030711
and be the giant carp...

###36060000
Maybe... Just maybe...

###36060001
Hey, you there. Do you, perhaps...

###36100000
Do you know about carp scales?

###36100001
The priceless scales of the Divine Treasure Carp.

###36100200###36100400###36100500
You there.

###36100201
If you ever happen across another pot like mine...

###36100202
Ignore any requests he makes of you.

###36100203
He's the shame of our clan.

###36100204
He's a treasonous villain who attempted to kill the Great Carp for his own benefit.

###36100300
Most of my scales have returned.

###36100301
And I owe it all to you... Finally the time has come for him to pay the price for his crime.

###36100302
But scales are priceless...

###36100303
It's almost as if I'm priceless, too...

###36100304
Heheh.

###36100401
You've done a remarkable job thus far.

###36100402
I feel that I can rely on you. Will you listen to my tale?

###36100403
Or rather, my secret?

###36100501
Any interest in hearing my secrets?

###36100600###36120200
Hello again. Take care with that bait.

###36100601
Present it to the Great Carp.

###36100602
And remember, do it quietly. Be as stealthy as possible...

###36100603###36110005
Do that, and I'll bestow upon you the palace's secret treasure.

###36100604
Hehe... hehehehe.

###36100700
Even if things take a turn for the worse...

###36100701
be sure not to confuse my bait for his.

###36100702
He's nothing more than a vile traitor.

###36100703
Hehe.... Hehehehe.

###36100800###36120400
Precious... Much more precious...

###36110000
Sure.

###36110001
Oh, wonderful. Truly remarkable.

###36110002
Now, the secret I mentioned...

###36110003
I'd like you to present this bait to the Great Carp.

###36110004
Don't let anyone see, if you can help it. Be as stealthy as possible.

###36110101
Oh, do you doubt me?

###36110102
Surely it's just a misunderstanding.

###36110103
And misunderstandings can always be cleared up.

###36110104
Come on. You understand me, right? Right?

###36110201
I see I've yet to clear up this misunderstanding.

###36110202
But you could easily clear it up any time you like. Right?

###36120000
A well-bred man, you are.

###36120201
Quietly... Very, very quietly...

###36120202
Hehe... hehehehehe...

###36120300
Ohh, splendid, splendid...

###36130200
I-It's going to break!

###36130300
Stop, you'll break the pot!

###36130410
I did... nothing wrong... I'm innocent...

###36130411
Please forgive me... my sins...

###36130710
To kill one as precious as I...

###36130711
Have  you no shame...

###36160000
Hello... Hello...

###36160001
You there... Hello...

###37000000
(Pained groans)

###37000001
Please, try not to move.  It will make your wounds worse.

###37000002
No, I must go...

###37000003
There is a shinobi hunter amongst the bandits.

###37000004
He's highly skilled.  If I don't face him...

###37000005
(groans)

###37000006
I forbid it!  You're in no condition...

###38000000
Young man, please be careful.

###38000001
The palace nobles have a craving for the vitality of youth.

###38000002
They can't help themselves. They want nothing but to sap away more and more of it.

###38000004
The courtyard ahead in particular... it is accursed.

###38000005
It's crawling with palace nobles...

###38000006
If you must forge ahead, you'd best go around it.

###38000100
Why are you telling me this?

###38000101
... I have a favor to ask you, young man...

###38000103
It's about my father.

###38000104
My father is now a noble... And the moment he became one
he found himself entranced by a carp, the Great Carp.

###38000105
For a long, long time since, he's done nothing but feed that cursed carp.

###38000106
Young man. Please release my father from the carp's bewitching powers.

###38000107
I know my father wouldn't wish for an eternity like that...

###38000200
The courtyard is an accursed place.  
If you must forge ahead, you'd best go around it.

###38000201
... and if you see my father...

###38000202
Please release him from the carp's bewitching powers.

###38000203
He just feeds it, forever and ever.

###38000204
My father would never have wished for such an eternity...

###38000300
You've been through so much, father.

###38000301
Though it may not be for eternity, my sister and I will always be with you...

###38000302
So please, father, rest now...

###38060000###39060000
Excuse me, young man...

###38060001###39060001
Young man, excuse me...

###39000000
Young man, do you happen to be going to the palace?

###39000002
If you are, you should take the back path.

###39000003
Nowadays it's under water, but there is a large cave you can take to get there.
Only, I hear the Great Carp now sleeps there...

###39000100
Why are you helping me..?

###39000101
...The gates to the palace have been closed for a long time now.

###39000102
I have a very important task I must tend to,
but I couldn't possibly do it with this body of mine...

###39000103
Might you open the door to the palace, young man...?

###39000200
Nowadays it's under water, but there is a large cave that will take you to the palace.
Only, I hear the Great Carp now sleeps there...

###39000201
... and if you do enter the palace... I was hoping you could you open the gate for me...

###39000202
I have a task I must accomplish...

###39000300
You... you beasts!

###39000301
You tricked him all this time!

###39000302
"Nobility" this, and "Eternity" that, pretty lies to fool him!

###39000303
Give him back!  Father... my father... give him back...

###39000304
(crying)

###40000000###40000700
Oh...? You survived?

###40000001
That accursed Gyoubu's finally a corpse, I take it?

###40000003
That changes nothing, you know.

###40000004
There'll be more wars, there'll be more corpses, and deep-seated hatred will run wild.

###40000005
Where's all that hatred go?
Haven't you ever wondered?

###40000007
Guess not. Guess you haven't.

###40000008
That's why I pity you, and I pitied him.

###40000100###40000300###40000600
Now then, be gone already.

###40000101
There's no end to war, no matter what this old hag says.

###40000102
Your duties will never change either.

###40000103
That's just how it is.

###40000200
You want something?

###40000202
If not, be gone.

###40000203
...War is on the horizon. A dreadful one at that.

###40000204
The dead will rise as mountains, the hate will flow like an inferno...

###40000205
It will give birth to a demon, I'm certain of it.

###40000301
I doubt you'd want to meet a demon, would you?

###40000400
Oh...? You're still alive?

###40000401###40000701
... You know, don't you?
You know who the one-armed demon was before...

###40000500
... Some advice.

###40000501
The hatred he channeled has lost its vessel for now.

###40000502
The longer the fires of war rage on, the more ashen this world will become.

###40000503
... That does not mean you should step into his place.

###40000601
You have your duties... 

###40000602
Things you must accomplish, yes?

###40010001
(Hmph...) Then you know there's no reason to lose heart.

###40010002
To carve and sculpt buddhas for so long, 
only to be wreathed in the flames of hatred and turn into a demon...

###40010003
... It was the fate he made for himself, to pay for his own mistakes.

###40010004
And you put an end to that. You sent him on his way.

###40010005
... I'm sure he's grateful for that...

###40010101
(Hmph...) I see. It might be better that way.

###40010102
What a fate, to be set ablaze in the fires of hatred
 and suffer eternally as a demon...

###40010103
You put an end to his misery. That's all it was.

###41000000###41000100###41000200###42000000###42000100###42000200###43000000###43000100###43000200###44000000###44000100###44000200###45000000###45000100###45000200###46000000###46000100###46000200
Care to purchase an offering?

###41000001###42000001###43000001###44000001###45000001###46000001
An offering?

###41000002###42000002###43000002###44000002###45000002###46000002
Indeed. I sell items to be offered to the dead, so they might rest in peace.

###41000003
From the looks of you, I'd wager you know a thing or two about death.

###41000004###41000104###42000004###42000104###43000004###44000005###44000105###45000004###45000104###46000004###46000104
...go ahead, buy an offering.

###41000101###43000101###44000101###45000101###46000101
Another one.....

###41000102###41020000###42000102###42020000###43000102###43020000###44000102###44020000###45000102###45020000###46000102###46020000
Where you find the departed, you'll find the Memorial Mob...

###41000103###41020001
Just like the crows.

###41000300
Hey you...I thought I told you to stop.

###41000301###41900503
Now, how about an offering?

###41020002###43020001###44020001###45020001###46020001
Wherever your travels take you, make sure you bring some offerings with you.

###41020100###42020100###43020100###43020200###44020100###45020100###46020100
May the departed rest in peace...

###41020200
Don't use that thing around here.
You'll scare the crows.

###41020201
They're very intelligent. Leaps and bounds smarter than other animals.

###41020202
Cruelty won't be tolerated...

###41030300###42030300
Curse you!

###41030410###42030410###43030410###44030401
May the departed...  rest... in peace...

###41900001###42900001###43900001###44900001###45900001###46900001###47900001
What's wrong with you?

###41900002
Memorial offerings and illnesses go hand in hand...

###41900003###42900003
(Wheeze... Wheeze...) Chest... So tight...

###41900004###42900004###43900004###44900005###45900006###46900004
I must... make an offering...

###41900010###42900010###43900010###44900010###45900010###46900010###47900010
You've caught it, too..

###41900102###42900102###44900102###45900102
Thanks.

###41900500
 I've been cured, thanks to you.

###41900501###42900501###43900501###45900501###46900501
Thank heavens. Now I can continue my life's work of selling offerings.

###41900502
After all... no one escapes death.

###42000003###43000003###44000003###45000003###46000003
From the looks of you, I'd wager you have a lot of blood on your hands.

###42000101
Another one...

###42000103
A battlefield is our paradise.

###42020001
Wherever your travels take you, make sure you bring some offerings.

###42900002
Must've caught something... on the battlefield...

###42900500
Looks like I've been cured, thanks to you.

###42900502
I expect the Ashina in particular will be needing a lot.

###42900503###43900504###44900504###45900503###46900504
Now, can I interest you in an offering?

###43000103
We, the impure, cannot turn a blind eye to anyone.

###43000104
... Go ahead, buy an offering.

###43000300
... You're no stranger to cruelty, I see.

###43000301
You've brought such an earnest samurai to a place such as this...

###43000302
While we don't concern ourselves with the living, I must say,

###43000303
some day, this will come back to haunt you.

###43000310
To bring a naïve, kindhearted man to a place such as this...

###43000400
... Need an offering?

###43030300
You're insane!

###43900002
I've been... cursed... (Wheeze... Wheeze...)　

###43900003
It's this place... so much brutality...

###43900102
Thank you

###43900500
Looks like the curse has been lifted, thanks to you.

###43900502
Those who cannot die are tormented and consumed by their grudges...

###43900503
They are truly in need of our offerings.

###44000004###44000104###44020002###44020101###44900502
(Cough, hack...)

###44000103
Even in places where people simply drift along...

###44010000
Hey, you there.
Don't go into that cave up ahead.

###44010001
Inside is an old shrine where the Serpent God dwells.

###44010002
And if the Serpent God swallows you,
you can't buy any more offerings now, can you?

###44010003
(Hacking cough...)

###44030300###45030300
Curse... you...

###44900003
The poison's... finally spread...

###44900004
Oh, well... Too late now...

###44900101
(Groan... Gulp...)

###44900500
Looks like the spasms have stopped, thanks to you.

###44900501
Thank heavens. Now I can continue my life's work of selling offerings for a while longer.

###44900503
... Old bones are best suited for spots like this.

###45000103
There'll be none to mourn you should you forget the Buddha.

###45010000
...Have you met the Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters?

###45010001
It was by a hair's breadth, but mercifully, she survived. 

###45010002
Though she must have suffered greatly...
You'd best treat her kindly.

###45010003
Here. This is from me.

###45010004
I wanted to share it with all the children...

###45030401
Oh, Divine Children... Forgive me...

###45900002
Buddha's just... and righteous punishment.

###45900003
I had no idea the Divine Children...

###45900004
Were suffering so badly...

###45900005
I see now...

###45900500
Looks like Buddha's punishment is over, thanks to you.

###45900502
I made a promise to those children, after all.

###46000005
(Mischievous chuckling.)

###46000103
Even those who can't die still have use for offerings!

###46000105###46020002###46020101###46900503
Heehee, heeheehee!

###46030200
Stop it!

###46030300
Please, leave me alone!

###46030410
Memorial Mob... everyone... I'm sorry...

###46900002
More sake... I just need... more sake...

###46900003
(Wheeze... Wheeze...) Not enough sake, that means...

###46900102
(Panting) Thank you.

###46900500
My horrible thirst's been quenched, thanks to you.

###46900502
... Doesn't matter if you can die or not.  Plenty of offerings to be made and drinking to be done!

###47000000###47000600
You're not one of the samurai of this castle, are you, friend?

###47000001
You look like a shinobi... and a skilled one at that.

###47000100
Of course, I'll make it worth your while.

###47000101
I make my living selling information.

###47000102
Take care of the samurai around here for me... 

###47000103
And I'll let you in on something really special, friend.

###47000200
Oh, of course, I'll make it worth your while. We're making a deal, after all.

###47000300
You're a real friend, friend. I owe you.

###47000301
Here, as promised. It's all yours.

###47000302
See ya, pal.
Maybe we'll cross paths again someday.

###47000400
Yeah? You still need something?

###47000401
Sorry, but I don't do business in dangerous places like this.

###47000402
He who fights and runs away, you know?

###47000403###47000501
Maybe we'll cross paths again someday.

###47000500
Look friend, you're not gonna convince me.
I don't do business in dangerous places.

###47000601
You look like a shinobi... a skilled one.

###47010001###47010201###47110001
Hehe, thought so.

###47010002
In that case... What say you take care of the samurai around here? 

###47010003###47010104
Some... unfortunate things happened...
And now they're after me day and night... I’m at the end of my rope here.

###47010004###47010105
I tell ya, these Ashina samurai got a stick so far up their...
Well, you'd think they'd have bigger things to worry about than chasing after me anyway.

###47010101
Hehe, fair enough.

###47010102
All right, what say we make a deal?

###47010103
I need you to take care of the samurai around here. 

###47010202###47010302
Well, you sure got me out of the pot.

###47010203###47010303
Ya see, some... unfortunate things happened...
And then they were after me day and night... I was at the end of my rope!

###47010204###47010304
But boy, did you show them!

###47010205###47010305
Here, take this with my thanks.

###47010206###47010306
See, I deal in information. It's how I make my living.

###47010301###47110101
Hehe, I see.  Fair enough.

###47030000
Ouch!

###47030100
S-Stop it, friend!

###47030200
Cut it out!

###47030300
That hurt, you bastard!

###47030410
I'm such an idiot...

###47030411
I totally... misjudged you...

###47100000
Hey, it's you!
Thanks again for bailing me out back at Ashina Castle.

###47100001
I'm gonna be hanging around here for a while.
I need time to sort through all the info I've got.

###47100002
Speaking of which, I'm happy to do business with you anytime. Interested?

###47100100
So friend, are you a shinobi or what?

###47100200
Hey there, friend.

###47100201
Still have some business with me?

###47100300
So it's finally begun...

###47100301
Isshin Ashina's gone, and the Central Forces have launched one hell of an invasion.

###47100302
The Ashina are likely finished now.

###47100303
Maybe it's time I wrapped up here, too...

###47100304###47100400
Any more business with me, friend?

###47110002
In that case, I've got information that might... peak your interest.

###47110003
Surely a shinobi like you understands the value of good information.

###47110102
Anyways, you came at a good time.

###47110103
Wanna buy some information, friend?

###47110200
Ah, so you're looking for goods instead of info, huh?

###47110201
I've always had sticky fingers, I guess. I end up collecting lots without really noticing.

###47110202
I got fed up with all the offerings and memorials, so I left the Mob, but...
When I see a dead body, I can't leave it unpilfered.

###47110203
Besides, property can belong to anyone, right?

###47110204###47110405
(Laughs.)

###47110300
Hey, friend.
If you're going to Ashina Castle, be careful.

###47110301
They've got all kinds of strange ones there now, and lots of 'em, at that.

###47110302
I know the Interior Ministers are afraid of Isshin Ashina,
but it looks like they found their nerve.

###47110303
Tide might be turning for Ashina...

###47110400
Looks like that damned near immortal samurai's finally gone and died.

###47110401
I tell you, I don't understand what goes on in the mind of an honest samurai.

###47110402
If you're not gonna die, you should go off and enjoy yourself.

###47110403
Anyways, nice job friend.

###47110404
I'm sure he went to heaven.

###47110500
Oh, if you're looking for the Sculptor, he's gone.

###47110501
He stumbled off muttering something about "the flames..."

###47110502
I think he was heading towards the battlefield.

###47110503
But where he went and why he went there's none of my business.

###47110600
Until next time, friend.

###47900002
F-Friend... I can't... breathe...

###47900003
D-Damn it... I'm not gonna die here...

###47900102
Th-Thanks...

###47900500
Hey, friend! I've been waiting for you.

###47900501
That medicine saved my life. I can't thank you enough.

###47900502
Here, take this. Hopefully you'll find it useful.

###47900503
Of course, I've got plenty of other tidbits lined up.

###48000000
... Yet another who is lost in the Halls of Illusion?

###48000001
I believe you are on a mission... and wish to leave this place...

###48000003
Then you must defeat the monkeys depicted on the panels at the hall entrance.

###48000004
Once you have done so, the Divine Child's voice will reach you.

###48000100
Is there something you would like to ask me?

###48000101
I will tell you anything that is within the realm of my knowledge.

###48000200###48000300
... Why have you returned?

###48000201
As you do not have any missions to complete here,
I ask that you leave... quietly.

###48000301
Kotaro and I both...wish to remain here free from distraction.
I ask that you leave... quietly.

###48010000
The monkey in the purple kimono is the "seeing monkey".

###48010001
He has excellent eyesight, can see great distances, and is very attentive...

###48010002
If he spots you, he will run immediately.

###48010003###48010103
He is exceedingly timid.

###48010100
The monkey in the green kimono is the "hearing monkey".

###48010101
he has excellent hearing, can hear across great distances, and is very attentive...

###48010102
He will generally run away the moment he hears you coming, making it hard to approach.

###48010200
The monkey in the orange kimono is the "speaking monkey".

###48010201
While he does not have particularly good eyesight or hearing...

###48010202
He makes a big fuss when he sees a threat, causing all other monkeys to run.

###48010203
Or perhaps he merely enjoys toying with humans?

###48010300
I do not wish to leave the Halls of Illusion.

###48010301
It is usually quiet here, which means it is near to nirvana in its own way.
... At least that is how it feels to me.

###48010302
I pray that you succeed.

###48020000
... Oh yes, by the way...

###48020001
There was once someone who, like you, was on a mission.

###48020002
I believe he chased the monkeys for a while but...
Everything here eventually went silent.

###48020003
...I pray that you succeed.

###49000000
...he said I'd find a cowardly wolf here.
No sign of him though...

###49000001
... A broken and incompetent shinobi living in disgrace.
I hoped to see such a man for myself, but seems I'm out of luck.

###49000002
And if he truly cannot die, I'm sure I'll run into him at some point...

###49000100
Oh... you... Are you the wolf... he spoke of?

###49000101
You don't look all that cowardly...

###49000102
That matters not. They say you're immortal... let's see if that's true.

###49000190
Hey, you there.  Are you the wolf they spoke of?

###49000200
Bastard!!

###50030000
For the sake of my son...

###50030001
Put down your sword.

###50030002
I will not.

###50030003
You are a fool.

###50030100
Your sword cannot pierce my armor.

###50030101
Why do you not understand?

###50030201
My armor is immovable.  I cannot fall.

###50030300
Ugh!  Trying to topple me off the edge?!

###50030301
Do not kick my prized armor!

###50030400
Strike me all you like, I am unbreakable.

###50030401
My son will receive the waters...

###50030500
Roberrrrrrt!!

###50030510
Arrrrrrrghhh!

###60000000
Damn noisy birds...

###60000010
That red-faced brute is fearsome indeed.

###60000011
Things could get quite out of hand without a proper flame...

###60000020
Did you hear?

###60000021
They say the leaves are still a deep red beyond the gorge behind the castle.

###60000022
What a curious thought...

###60000030
The voices...they call from below...

###60000031
Heh heh... Could it finally be my time?

###60000040
Blasted vermin...swarming the
hidden temple as if they own the place...

###60000041
Still, the flame techniques they use are quite something.

###60000042
Surely even the red-faced ogre would shrink at the sight.

###60000050
Eavesdrop dummy text (the Imperial Prince is in the Moon-view tower)

###60000100
That bastard red-faced brute. Even in chains he's out of control.

###60000101
But y'know what they say: "The red ogre fears the flame."

###60000102
Ahh. The peddler near the stables was mumbling something about that.

###60000103
She's the only one of those Hirata drifters with any sense left.

###60000200
What's the status of the "Imperial Prince"?

###60000201
He's been in the "moon-view tower" the whole day, with his books.

###60000202
Do we really need all these guards for one little kid?

###60000203
Guess it's because they picked him up at Hirata.
An orphan from the ill-fated bloodline.

###60000300
That old hag in the "abandoned building by the cliff".

###60000301
Won't she ever give it a rest with that bloody "bell"?

###60000302
I hear ya. Gives me the creeps.
None of the ones from Hirata survived with their senses.

###60000303
Doesn't matter. It's a cold one this year.

###60000304
Doubt she or her son will last the winter.

###60000400
Who would you say is the strongest in all of Ashina?

###60000401
It's gotta be Lord Gyoubu Oniwa.

###60000402
"Gyoubu, the Demon of Ashina".
That mountain of corpses on the battlefield past here says it all.

###60000403
But they say that even Gyoubu the Demon was once felled.

###60000404
His beloved steed Onikage was spooked by some "shinobi firecrackers".

###60000405
Oh ho, that massive horse? Frightened by firecrackers?

###60000406
Said the shinobi went by the name of Horned Owl... 

###60000407
Had "special gunpowder" made for him
by his mates at the "Hirata Estate".

###60000500
Older Bandit: This shrine's bloody locked.
Guhah hah, there's bound to be heaps of treasure inside!

###60000501
Younger Bandit: Treasure? Sounds good, brother.
We should hurry and tell Lord Juzou.

###60000502
Older Bandit: Idiot! Don't tell the boss!

###60000503
Younger Bandit: Sorry, brother.

###60000504
Older Bandit: You know what?
Someone around here must be hiding a key.
We gotta find it!

###60000600
Hell's teeth, lugging that heavy chest plate
was hard work.

###60000601
Still, no sword will be a match for that armour,
especially when we fit those giant louts with it.

###60000602
... Unless someone rips it off.

###60000603
How would they do that?

###60000604
Say, by using a special lance from the Hidden Jail gatehouse.

###60000700
That flipping fugitive ninja is pushing his luck.

###60000701
Just how long is he going to keep up this chase?

###60000702
There was word of someone causing a stir
around Hebitani. Maybe I should check it out.

###60000800
About Valley Mercenary Snipers

###60000900
About Headless Yasha Ape's relocation

###60001000
Next time, we will succeed... 

###60001001
We will achieve...true immortality.

###60001002
The red-eyes fear the flame. A travesty.
This will not do.

###60001400
The moonlight shines strongly on the Moon-view Tower tonight...

###60001401
The Divine Heir is probably using the light for his reading again...

###60001402
Probably.

###60001403
But imprisoning a mere child... I feel sorry for the boy.

###60001404
Agreed.  But I'm sure Lord Genichiro has his reasons...

###60001500
The Moon-view Tower door... you checked that it's locked, right?

###60001501
It's certainly locked, but...

###60001502
Nobody fixed that hole in the wall...

###60001503
That?  Don't worry about it.

###60001504
The hole faces the edge of a cliff.  No one could pass through it.

###60001600
You know the secret passage at the bottom of the moat, under the bridge?

###60001601
We just got orders to guard it.

###60001602
Security's getting tight.

###60001603
War will be upon us very soon.

###60001700
... this battle... do you think it can be won?

###60001701
I fear we may not prevail.

###60001702
What?  We'll be just fine!

###60001703
Look, Isshin may be sick, but he's still going strong.
And Genichiro is a terror with a bow.

###60001704
And of course, we have Gyoubu the Demon!

###60001705
Ahh, Gyoubu, of course!

###60001706
Good point.  As long as he's with us...

###60001707
No man could ever breach the Ashina Castle gate.

###60001800
I don't feel safe with that big bastard just tied up next to us.

###60001801
I'd rather not be gravely injured just before the war begins.

###60001802
...if the worst happens, only choice is to use fire.

###60001803
Those red eyes fear fire. That's what the lord's proclamation said.

###60001804
Proclamations... what a joke.  Ashina sure has a funny way of preparing for war...

###60001900
Look... A smoke signal from the great castle gate.

###60001901
Is it Lord Gyoubu...?

###60001902
Yes, that's definitely Gyoubu the Demon.

###60001903
Ashina is safe so long as that man guards her doors.

###60002000
Kokage... My poor, poor horse...

###60002001
All it took was a bit of gunpowder, he startled...

###60002002
And now he's dead... Dead...

###60002100
... We burning this temple next, boss?

###60002101
No, leave it. Go on to the next one.

###60002102
... But, if there's any offerings we could give them to Lord Juzou...

###60002103
Enough!

###60002104
We don't take from Buddha...
How many times do I have to tell ya before it sinks into your thick skull?!

###60002105
Please don't get angry at me, boss.

###60002106
I'm sorry my skull's so thick...

###60002200
Hey, open up!  Open up or else!

###60002201
I can hear you whispering in there!

###60002202
If you don't surrender peaceably now, you're gonna regret it later!

###60002203
Hey, can you hear me?!  Hey!!

###60002300
... I bet the estate fire is totally out of control by now...

###60002301
Yeah... If anyone's gonna get out, their only choice is to use this cave.

###60002302
Don't let a single rat escape.
Lord Juzou's orders.

###60002303
I know.

###60002304
And I don't mind at all.  I can't stand selfish bastards who leave everyone else behind at the first sign of danger...

###60002400
... It seems Isshin's illness is indeed grave.

###60002401
The Land of Ashina will not last much longer,
even with Genichiro on our side.

###60002402
What about our other mission?

###60002403
... Blackhat is fighting like a demon by the Serpent Valley side of the castle.

###60002404
Then that's where we're going next.

###60002405
But keep your wits about you... The Blackhat Badger won't go down without a fight...

###60002500
We're really planning to use that thing...in the battle?

###60002501
I know, I know.  But what choice do we have?

###60002502
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  We're in no position to worry about what others might think.

###60002503
Yes, but...

###60002504
Hey, keep it together, soldier. Keep talking like that, and they'll put you on its detail.

###60002505
And when it's mad, it doesn't discriminate between friend or foe.  

###60002600
I heard you were the one that put the armor on that big bugger from Taro Troop.

###60002601
Yeah, he was making a stink about it.
It was a damned awful job.

###60002602
But it looks like it paid off, didn't it?

###60002603
He already had a huge frame and massive strength, and you just made him near impervious to blades.

###60002604
That is true, but...
He doesn't like that armor, and he sure didn't like me putting it on him.

###60002605
When a fight happens, it might come off easier than you think.

###60002700
You're saying we don't have enough salt?

###60002701
Yes, sir... We use it for cooking, of course...

###60002702
But we also use it on wounds and for purifying the dead...

###60002703
So at the rate people are dying... we're out, then?

###60002704
Yes, sir... That's why many on the battlefield are falling ill...

###60002705
I see... We'll need to find a way to get some salt then...

###60002800
Where's the next shift...?

###60002801
My watch ended a while ago,

###60002802
But no one's coming to take my place...

###60002900
Masanari...

###60002901
I never would have believed a man of your ability could be slain...

###60002902
It appears as though a demon lurks within Ashina...

###60003001
... The tides will soon turn against this land...

###60003002
I never would've thought the Interior Ministry would become our enemy...

###60003003
If the old lord falls... we'll be defeated swifly, no doubt.

###60003004
... I'm wondering though, if that happens, will we still get paid?

###60003005
There's no point in running away with an empty purse...

###60003100
([Buddhist chanting] Namu Amida Butsu, Namu Amida Butsu...)

###60003101
(Sigh...)

###60003102
... Everyone..  Forgive me.

###60003103
But nobody would put their life on the line for free...

###60003104
All right, so... how do I make my escape...?

###60003200
(Cackle...)

###60003201###60003290
Those backwater Ashina shinobi...
took the bait beautifully, not even knowing it was a trap.

###60003202
How dumb can you be?

###60003300
Impossible... How did...?

###60003400
Taking the Hirata Estate was suprisingly easy.

###60003401
Owl's info was right on the money, you know?

###60003402
... I don't like him.

###60003403
There's something shifty about him... the smell of a crook.

###60003404
(Gulp, gulp, gulp) Ahh...

###60003405
He's a villain... a down and out villain, Masanari...

###60003406
Well... he's useful right now, so endure him.

###60003407
For all his scheming, he's a nameless, rogue shinobi.

###60003408
His efforts won't amount to much.

###60003409
(Buuurp.)

###60003410
Heh.  I'm not complaining so long as there's coin and booze in it.

###60003500
... Lord Isshin, I will be borrowing this.

###60003501
Please watch over me...

###60003502
We, the Ashina clan, will win this battle...

###60003590
... Lord Isshin, I am returning what I borrowed.

###60003591
Lord Isshin... please watch over me...

###60003600
... Did you kill them all?

###60003601
I did...

###60003602
Good... We will begin when Lord Genichiro returns.

###60003603
... We will revive Ashina together with the Dragon's Blood.

Guhah hah! Look at it burn!

###65000101
This thing is great.
Fancy finding a fire-spewing pipe.

###65000102
Those shinobi buggers carry the strangest things.

###65000200
Dingy Bandit: See that bodyguard?
He put one of those shinobi down like it was nothing.

###65000201
Tired-eyed Bandit: Should hope so. He's a shinobi hunter from Hachiyouji.

###65000202
Dingy Bandit: Apparently he takes the belongings of those he kills.
A collector of sorts.

###65000203
Tired-eyed Bandit: Seems that one from before was carrying some "shinobi gunpowder."

###65000300
You're one of Owl's, right?

###65000301
I appreciate the assistance.

###65000400
The young master is in the inner sanctum.

###65000401
You have to save him, no matter what.

###65000500
Where did that Temple shinobi go?

###65000501
He's around here somewhere.
A little scoundrel dressed in white.

###65000502
Clamouring about something or other.

###65000600
That shinobi at the bottom of the well...

###65000601
We didn't shackle him, restrain him, nothing.  That doesn't worry anybody...?

###65000602
Not at all.  Not only is he unarmed, he's completely lost his will to live.

###65000603
Nothing but a coward, unworthy of our concern.

###65000700
... Sounds like he's calmed down...

###65000701
Wha?!  The enemy is still alive!

###65000702
What?!  What about the bull?! Where's the bull?!

###65000800
I'm sure you are all aware already.

###65000801
This coming battle will determine the fate of all Ashina.

###65000802
We go now to risk our lives for Lord Isshin
and the peoples of Ashina.

###65000803
We are Ashina... we are unbreakable!

###65000804###65000805
Arrrghh!

###65000806
Arrrrrrrghh!

###65000807###65000808
For Ashina!

###65000809
For Ashina--!

###65000900
Hey, you didn't see a little scoundrel come running through here, did you?

###65000901
We're after one, and I'm fairly sure he came this way...

###65000902
Hmm... what was he wearing?

###65000903
He had a black hat on!  Short little guy!

###65000904
Hmm... thing is, nobody's passed this way at all.   
Only thing that did looked like some kind of animal... a raccoon?  Maybe a badger?  Couldn't say for sure.  

###65000905
You sure you didn’t mistake that animal for your criminal?

###65000906
Oh come on... ugh.  Forget it!

###65001000
Heard reports of a shinobi being seen somewhere around here.

###65001001
I heard the same, but... lately it feels like an everyday occurrence.

###65001002
I know.  Goes to show just how soon the battle will be upon us.

###65001003
Even more the reason to take these reports seriously...

###65001100
...Oh?  It's you...

###65001101
The demon has made his appearance.

###65001102
That works out quite well. I will take my revenge for Masanari!

###65001200
... Oh?  You're supposed to be dead...

###65001201
Yet... you still live?

###65001203
... It doesn't matter. I'll kill you now, and all will be as it's supposed to.

###65001300
Woahh! Look at it burn!

###65001301
Whoever called this a fire-breathing barrel wasn't kidding!
I can feel my spirits lifting already!

###65001302
You ain't wrong. This estate always rubbed me the wrong way.
But you gotta give it a good send off at least...

###70000000###70001003###70001104###70030000###70100000
(Groan...)

###70000001
... You're... the Son of... Owl....

###70001001
Thieves... at Hirata estate...

###70001002
You must, hurry... the Divine Heir...

###70001100
... What year is it?

###70001101
What year...? An odd question...

###70001103
It's the...year of the Dragonspring pilgrimage...

###70001105
The Dragonspring pilgrimage...

###70001106
That was three years ago...

###70001108
(The Sculptor mentioned an "old memory".)

###70001109
(I don't remember any of this...)

###70001110
(but it appears this is the past...)

###70001190
That was two years ago...

###70001191
That was four years ago...

###70001192
That was five years ago...

###70010000
Those... worthless bastards...

###70010002
...You are... shinobi if... if I'm not mistaken...

###70010003
Take the shinobi axe from... from the temple...

###70010004
And... split... their skulls wide open...

###70010090
Grind their corpses into the dirt... shields and all... 

###70020000
... You... You're the young master's shinobi...

###70020002
... What good are you?  You were nowhere to be seen when things went south...

###70020003
... Wait...

###70020004
Tell me you didn't lead them here yourself. 

###70020005
The timing of their attack was perfect... normally those bandits wouldn't have stood a chance.

###70020006
Yes... yes, it had to be you...

###70020007
I hope you die, traitor!

###70030001
The gun fort ... Was even more formidable than we'd heard...

###70030002
We were reckless... to go in unprepared...

###70030003
Ahh, it takes me back... I can hear... the Senpou temple bell... Ughh...

###70040000
(Grunt... Groan...)

###70040001
... Who... or what.. did this to you?

###70040002
Large... ape...

###70040003
My neck... my neck...

###70040004
(Groans)

###70050000
Hey... hey you... (Cough, cough...)

###70050001
If you know the path of Buddha...
Would you slay one who opposes it?

###70050002
One who opposes the Buddha?

###70050003
Correct... (Cough, cough...)
The one of whom I speak hides in an abandoned temple up ahead...

###70050004
He's sealed away the village in a shadowy fog... so that he can fool the villagers.

###70050005
An abandoned temple...?

###70050006
Yes, it's an old building... (Cough, cough...)

###70050007###70050103
The door may be closed, but there should be a hole in the second floor.

###70050100
... Come, will you slay he who opposes Buddha?

###70050102
The abandoned temple he hides in is an old building...

###70050200
I've gotten terribly old, but...

###70050201
This old man would like to see Lord Buddha return to his temple once more...

###70060000###70060100###70080000
(Groan... Moan...)

###70060001###70060101
The shinobi... they're...

###70060002###70060102
In the moat...

###70060003###70102007###70102107
(Groans and chokes...)

###70060090###70060190
In-... truders...

###70070000
...it's you...

###70070002
The Divine Heir and Lady Emma... they're being targeted...

###70070003
Could I ask you... to protect them...?

###70070005
To think I'd have to ask for your help...

###70070006
It's truly... maddening...

###70080001
Up ahead... The Interior Ministry’s stronghold...

###70080002
Bring them down and...there’s still...

###70080003
Ashina w-will...

###70080004
(Groans...)

###70090000
... Ahh...  Everything was burning...

###70090001
... The fires raging out of control...

###70090002
... The howling was intense...

###70100001
... You... you're a shinobi, right...?

###70100002
Please, reinforce the men in the Castle Outskirts... 

###70100003
They're on the verge... of defeat...

###70100090
...You're a shinobi... of Ashina, are you not...?

###70100091
... You're... the shinobi of the Divine Heir, are you not...?

###70102001
You have... my gratitude...

###70102002
Climb that mud wall to get to the roof...

###70102003
There should be a shinobi kite there...

###70102004###70102104
Forget about me...

###70102005
Help our men in the Castle Outskirts... please...

###70102006###70102106###70110005
For... Ashina...

###70102101
You can...

###70102102
Climb on that mud wall to get to the roof...

###70102103
There should be a shinobi kite flying there...

###70102105
Help those in the Castle Outskirts...

###70102190
Climb up there to reach the roof...

###70110000
You're... part of the reinforcement force, right...?

###70110001
Please... please hurry...

###70110002
The castle outskirts... are in bad shape...

###70110003
The damned ministry forces... They've taken up to serpent valley and raised a bridge...

###70110004
Please... save Ashina...

###70110090
Cross the bridge... reach the outskirts...
