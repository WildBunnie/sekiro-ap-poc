memory provided sustenance for the Wolf.

Gyoubu Oniwa once led a group of infamous
bandits, but was defeated by Isshin, who
was so captivated by his show of strength
that he took him in as an Ashina warrior.
Oniwa would later go on to become
Genichiro Ashina's most trusted retainer.

###5301
The battle memory of an extraordinary foe.
Although distant, recollection of such a
memory provided sustenance for the Wolf.

Although distant, recollection of such a
memory provided sustenance for the Wolf.

Born a peasant, Genichiro Ashina was taken
in by the Ashina after his mother's death.
With his country on the brink of defeat,

Such heresy may be the key to saving her.

###5303
The battle memory of an extraordinary foe.
Although distant, recollection of such a
memory provided sustenance for the Wolf.

The Halls of Illusion lie on the threshold
betwixt life and death.  Departed souls of
the Divine Children drift and sway, taking
shelter in the monkeys of the temple.
Such is why the Divine Child of
Rejuvenation speaks of them as friends.

###5304
The battle memory of an extraordinary foe.
Although distant, recollection of such a
memory provided sustenance for the Wolf.

They say that an infested body is the mark
of the undying, but such a long life would
surely be quite lonesome for even an ape.

Perhaps the echoing roar of the Guardian
Ape was in fact a solicitation of sorts...

###5305
The battle memory of an extraordinary foe.
Although distant, recollection of such a
memory provided sustenance for the Wolf.

The Corrupted Monk donned the mask
of a fierce guardian deity. Her form was
nebulous, appearing as if in a dream.

What reason could there have been for
guarding the Mibu Village cave entrance?

###5306
The battle memory of an extraordinary foe.
Although distant, recollection of such a
memory provided sustenance for the Wolf.

The Great Shinobi Owl's unbridled ambition
was to obtain the power of the Dragon's
Heritage. Now is the time to let one's true
name ring out across all of Japan.

It was all for the sake of this ambition.

###5307
The battle memory of an extraordinary foe.
Although distant, recollection of such a
memory provided sustenance for the Wolf.

Owl took in the hungry cub on a whim and
raised him as a shinobi. The process was
so engrossing that he hoped they might
enjoy a true battle to the death some day.

###5308
The battle memory of an extraordinary foe.
Although distant, recollection of such a
memory provided sustenance for the Wolf.

The Corrupted Monk was among the infested,
standing over the Fountainhead Palace.

memory provided sustenance for the Wolf.

The Divine Dragon of the Everblossom came
from the west long ago, eventually making
its way to this land.

and soil allowed the Dragon to take root.

###5310
The battle memory of an extraordinary foe.
Although distant, recollection of such a
memory provided sustenance for the Wolf.

A man who failed to become Shura instead
became a vessel for the flames of hatred.
As fate would have it, he was bound
stubbornly to this world.
It wasn't until he became a demon that he
was finally able to depart for the next.

###5311

Although distant, recollection of such a
memory provided sustenance for the Wolf.

and that is precisely what he got.

###5312
The battle memory of an extraordinary foe.
Although distant, recollection of such a
memory provided sustenance for the Wolf.

The elderly Isshin was akin to a sharpened
blade.  His steadily honed techniques
culminated in the Ashina Style, soundly
eliminating all wasted or idle movement.
A master who took the spirit of his craft
to its pinnacle; a true sword saint.

###5313
The battle memory of an extraordinary foe.
Although distant, recollection of such a
memory provided sustenance for the Wolf.

At one time the Guardian Ape shared its
den with a mate.  But he alone became

to her passing have withered to dust.

Although distant, recollection of such a
memory provided sustenance for the Wolf.

technique that not even a lifetime
could attain.  And yet in memory, after
countless bouts with his mortal enemy,
Genichiro at last reached those heights.

###5321
The battle memory of an extraordinary foe.
Although distant, recollection of such a
memory provided sustenance for the Wolf.

Owl once abandoned the young Wolf in
Usui Forest, expecting him to fend against
the illusions, likely never to return.
Only in victory would he recognize the
boy as his son.  In this way, and this way
alone, he raised the Wolf as his own.

###5322
The battle memory of an extraordinary foe.
Although distant, recollection of such a
memory provided sustenance for the Wolf.

All his life, Isshin sought opponents
whom he could face in battle to the death.

thirst could be sated in memory.
To face the one who cut him down...
How the blood boils at the thought.

###5510

Grants the ability to exchange Skill Points for Attack Power in the Sculptor's Idol menu.

###5600
An item that is rarely dropped by a Divine Heir of the Dragon's Heritage.
Using it will slightly increase Resurrective Power.
Restore the power of life to those who have been drained of it by offering this drop to the Sculptor's Idol with the Recovery Charm in hand.  In turn, all afflicted with the Dragonrot will be healed.
The incessant coughing must cease.

###6000
Iron dregs mined in Ashina.

Widely used for basic reinforcement, it can serve as a base material for Prosthetic Tool upgrades.

Ashina is burdened with thick snow
and infertile land, but the scrap iron
dug from her soil is anything but crude.

###6010
Magnetic ore mined in Ashina.

Base material commonly used in
Prosthetic Tool upgrades of
intermediate and higher rank.

Forging with magnetite produces a hard
steel; a precious commodity in Ashina.
Bedrock offering up this ore is constantly
mined out, making it a rare one at that.

###6020
Adamantine ore with a dull, silvery shine.

Base material commonly used in
advanced Prosthetic Tool upgrades.

Adamantite can only be mined in the oldest
parts of Ashina.  Ancient rock and soil is
said to attract the grace of gods, perhaps
lending this metal its supple strength.

###6100
Black grains forming the
base for gunpowder.

Material used in alchemical
Prosthetic Tool upgrades,
including those of an explosive
and occultic nature.

Even the most mundane form of gunpowder
has a wide variety of applications.

###6200
Amber-colored grains forming the base
for powerful gunpowder.  A precious
commodity only found in the Sunken Valley.

Used for explosive Prosthetic Tool
upgrades of intermediate and higher rank.

The yield from yellow powder is greater
than that of black, lending the valley
stronghold defenses their fiery vigor.

###6210
Highly precious grains forming the base
for a devastating form of gunpowder.

Used in explosive Prosthetic Tool upgrades
of advanced rank.

Created in secret by the Interior Ministry
using knowledge from across southern seas.
The central forces' military might owes
much to this tiny tweak of chemistry.

###6300

Can be used for intermediate and higher Occultic upgrades for Prosthetic Tools.

Considered omens of disease, they are known to grow larger as the illness worsens.

###6310
A lump of fatty wax that has formed
inside the body and turned pitch black.

Used for occultic Prosthetic Tool
upgrades of an advanced nature.

growth turn large and blacker still.
It is customary to run water over the
site of an extracted growth.

###6400
Precious azure lazulite, used for the
highest level of Prosthetic Tool upgrades.

Fountainhead lazulite is a symbol of
eternity, and anything forged with it
will never break nor rust thanks to
the blessing of the Divine Dragon.
Tools forged with lazulite transcend
human intellect, and are dubbed as
treasures of the Divine Dragon.

###9000
Tears received from the Divine Dragon.
The gracious gift of tears can only be
granted by the Mortal Blade.

The body of the Divine Dragon is eternal,
and its tears, once shed, will maintain
their form and moisture in perpetuity.
Should one of the Dragon's Heritage
partake of the dragon's tears,
Immortal Severence will be reified.

###9003
Charm received from Kuro.

Placed on the Wolf's person in secret,
after he lost his life in Hirata Estate
and gained the power of Resurrection.

The charm has protected the Wolf well,
tempering his ordeals.
To part with it would mean facing a path
of hardship beyond that endured thus far.

###9009
Pale pink crystal residue known to form
when an immortal oath fails to establish.

Increases Resurrective Power,
allowing one additional resurrection.

To repeat the vows of the undying and
be awarded Resurrective Power once
more surely necessitates the aid of a
Divine Child of the Dragon's Heritage.

###9010
A bell charm received from an old woman, who asked that it be offered to Buddha.

Bell charms protect their holders through Buddha's divine protection.  If one finds themselves the owner of another's bell charm, offering it to Buddha on their behalf is common courtesy.
The Sculptor at the Dilapidated Temple
can advise on how it should be offered.

###9011
A bell charm previously owned by the Owl.

The Owl held this bell for a long time.
Offering it at the Dilapidated Temple may result in seeing a different memory than before.
There's no way of knowing why this protective bell exists.  Perhaps the Owl kept it for himself, or perhaps he meant to give it to someone...

###9020
A letter thrown into a well.

"Kuro's Wolf,
Your destiny awaits you
at the moon-view tower.
Escape from the well and find the
tower bathed in moonlight.

Even without a blade, you can reach it.
Stay silent.  Stay vigilant."

###9052
A carp that lived in the Mibu Village Pond.  
It has two red eyes.
Carp with only eyes that are red cannot become "masters".
Though they're considered incomplete creatures that lack the ideal number of scales, their eyes are said to be everlasting.
The researcher Dojun in the Abandoned Dungeon wants these eyes to improve his "procedure".

###9060
A tally board carved from a large piece of jade.
Possessing this increases the stocks that can be purchased in merchants' shops.
Such a tally board is highly prized by the merchant class.  Old custom dictates that those of dragon rank are recognized as supreme merchants by the imperial palace, and should be given the best possible treatment.

###9061
An Ashina trade promissory note.

Matabei Anayama's last piece of product.

Discounts the cost of items when purchasing from merchants.

A sen saved is a sen earned.
And so long as one draws breath, business will continue.

A cup filled with divine waters, a drink popular with nobles of the palace.

When a wedding procession arrives at the Fountainhead palace, this is the drink they are greeted with.

"The nectar of the palace nobles.
Go ahead, drink to your heart's content."

###9071
A priceless white whisker taken from the Great Colored Carp.
While the Great Carp is naturally immortal, if killed, its whiskers can be plucked.
The sound of the whisker being removed
is surely music to the ears of certain people.
Some would feel relief at the sound of their mission being completed, others, the joy of having their heart's desire granted.

###9080
A small pinwheel made of red and white paper.
Found about halfway up Mount Kongo.

The red and white pinwheels simply spin round and round.
Everyone is right here.

###9081
A small pinwheel made of white paper.
Found below a cliff at Mount Kongo.
Perhaps it was carried there by the wind.

It is simply a single, pure white pinwheel.
Only the child is right here.

###9090
Rice that has spilled forth from the hand of the Divine Child of Rejuvenation.
Intended to be a gift for Kuro.

"Rice is precious.
I want nothing more than for the Divine Heir of the Dragon's Heritage to get better."

Kuro would likely be pleased to receive it.

###9091
Tears that were shed by the Divine Child of Rejuvenation once she became the cradle.
They are but frozen drops.

By having Kuro drink both the
Dragon Tears and Frozen Tears,
the Cradling ritual can be performed.

Cold Dragon Tears are just that.

###9100
A bottle of Ashina-brewed sake.
Sake is a drink meant for sharing.

While it does not contain water from the fountainhead, it is made from the purest of waters, and is a drink beloved by the people of Ashina.

###9101
A bottle of cloudy, unrefined sake.
Sake is a drink meant for sharing.

This cloudy sake is one of Isshin Ashina's favorites.  It has a rich, full-bodied flavor.

On the other hand, it has a reputation for getting one too drunk, too quickly.

###9102
Alcohol created by dew pooled in a hollow tree.

Fruits hidden by monkeys in tree hollows can sometimes ferment and turn into sake with a bit of luck.

While it's known for its brutally harsh flavor, some find this acquired taste irresistible.

###9103
A bottle of crystal-clear sake.
Sake is a drink meant for sharing.
A top-shelf sake brewed by the Ashina brew master with water from the Dragonspring.
The pure water extracts every last bit of flavor from Ashina's finest rice.
There are no words that can do the flavor justice.  To understand, one must taste it for themselves.

###9104
A bottle of Ashina sake given by Emma.
Sake is a drink meant for sharing.

While it does not contain water from the fountainhead, it is made from the purest of waters, and is a drink beloved by the people of Ashina.

###9105
A bottle of cloudy, unrefined sake, given by Isshin.
Sake is a drink meant for sharing.

This cloudy sake is one of Isshin Ashina's favorites.  It has a rich, full-bodied flavor.

On the other hand, it has a reputation for getting one too drunk, too quickly.

###9180
This is precious bait.

The texture is slimy, and something resembling horns seem to jut out of it.  
Just the kind of bait the "master" loves.

"Ring the bell, drop the bait."

###9181
This is truly precious bait.

If bait has hair, you know it's something truly special.  
The Hirata noble in the pot is obsessed with thoughts of becoming a "master".

"He who receives the scales of the carp becomes closer to a carp himself...  
I bestow unto you my secret treasure."

###9182
This is truly precious bait.

If bait has hair, you know it's something truly special.  
The Fountainhead Palace noble in the pot is obsessed with becoming one with the "master."
"Present this bait to the master, the Great Carp.  Offer it earnestly, but quietly, so no one knows..."

###9192
The persimmon-like heart of a Great Serpent.

The Great Serpent is considered to be 
a god of the land, and the heart is believed
to be where one's spirit resides.
While its shape bears similarity to a persimmon, in fact this is the red viscera
of a god.  It is safe to assume that eating
it would be poisonous to one's health.

###9193
A dried, persimmon-like heart of a Great Serpent.
The Great Serpent is a god of the land, and the heart is believed to be where one's spirit resides.
While it looks much like a persimmon, in fact this is the red viscera of a god.
Apparently, denizens of the Sunken Valley worship the organs believing they represent the deity itself.

###9200
A page torn from the Ashina Herb Catalogue, a compendium of flowers and herbs.
"The 'Snap Seed' naturally grows in ravines and deep valleys.
According to denizens of the Sunken Valley, such places are appropriate for offering oneself in marriage to the Great Serpent.
If one wishes to become a bride, they must enter the belly of the Serpent in the valley."

###9205
An old note left by the surgeon Dosaku:

My disciples have abandoned me for Dogen.  Unwilling to dirty their own hands,
they all left me for that hypocritical quack.

Dojun! My last disciple!
Even if I die, the research must continue.
Finish the procedure, for Ashina's sake.
                                                            -Dosaku

###9206
A description of the "rats" that have snuck into Ashina.  Speak to the Tengu again once the rats are dealt with.

The rats:
- Assassins from Senpou Temple
- Short stature, wear bamboo hats
- A number of rats are lurking about
- Last seen around Ashina Castle Gate

###9207
A worn and bloodstained letter from Dosaku, the surgeon in the Abandoned Dungeon:
   Required: 1 tough man
   Preferably a strong samurai, or a young, 
   large soldier such as a member of
   the Taro Troop.

   Must be delivered unharmed.
                                                               -Dosaku

###9208
A tattered, blood-covered note written by Dosaku, the surgeon in the Abandoned Dungeon.

   At the bottom of the Mibu Village pond,
   You will find a Sakura carp.
   You will know it from its red eyes, 
   which are said to never rot.   
   I require those red eyes.
                                                                -Dosaku

###9209
Sacred passage on a path to enlightenment.
"Undying, I pray for the Dragon's return.
Undying, lo, let us wait an age; for the
Divine Heir to assimilate the cold dragon
tears; for the cradle to consume
the pair of serpentine fruits.

Let the cradle endure, giving Him shelter;
granting His return to the west."
 

###9210
A book from Kuro on the art of
severing ties with the Dragon's Heritage.
It looks old.  The binding is torn,
and several pages are missing.

"Herein describes the means to perform
the Rite of Immortal Severance.
Beyond the Fountainhead Palace, locate
the Sanctuary and imbibe the tears of
the holy dragon of the divine realm."

###9211
Part of the Book of Immortal Severance, left behind by Takeru.
"With Mortal Blade in hand,
my blood may be shed.

With my blood, the aroma will be complete,
the divine realm will be in reach.  
Immortal Severance will be at hand.
I must ask Tomoe to assist with the beheading..."

###9212
A note from Kuro, written by Takeru,
former Heir of the Dragon's Heritage.

"It is said that relatives of Tomoe once
gathered the Fountainhead Fragrance
and arrived at the palace.

You may find a key where the waters of
rejuvenation converge in a deep pool.
A white and deeply fragrant flower..."

###9213
An old note left by the Okami clan, who sought to reach the divine realm.

"A fragrant stone, enshrined in a village 
within the depths of Ashina.
One must throw oneself for it to be found.
With this, the fountainhead fragrance is complete.
Let us depart now, to the divine realm."

###9214
An old diary entry written by Takeru's page.

"Lord Takeru held his arm over the incense burner, and attempted to cut it with a sword.  But incredibly, his wound healed instantly, and not a drop of blood was shed.
Lady Tomoe said,
'Without it, your blood cannot be spilled.'

What could she be referring to, I wonder?"

###9215
A passage describing a journey to enlightenment.
"For an age, I have been blessed by the worm.  To be undying is to walk the eternal path to enlightenment, thus I must become enlightened to understand why I cannot die.  It is said the holy dragon's origins were in the west. So I wonder, how did the worm come to be bestowed upon me?"

###9216
A note written in Tomoe's soft handwriting.
"Lord Takeru's coughs are worsening still;
Returning to the divine realm is hopeless, and I wish only to sever the Dragon's Heritage and restore his humanity.
Restoration requires the Everblossom and Mortal Blade, and yet I cannot acquire the latter.  It was hidden by the High Priest of Senpou Temple, who has no desire to sever the immortal ties..."

###9217
A tattered note written by Anayama.
Seems to be from some years ago.

"Lucrative info #36

When we broke into Hirata Estate,
we found a barrel that spewed flame.
The boys lit a roaring bonfire with it
and made merry with the drink.
Must have been a shinobi's tool."

###9218
A note on smoke signals used by 
Ashina shinobi, the Grey Nightjars.

"Pale, pink smoke signals are placed
along the rooftops of Ashina Castle.

These signals guide the Nightjar.

The ashen-feathered flock are surely the
only ones able to follow such a trail."

###9219
A note left by Isshin in the watchtower.
Perhaps Emma knows his current whereabouts.

    Dear Emma,

    The Ashina Castle Gate has grown loud 
    with the sound of scurrying.
    The Tengu will see to the rats.
    Worry not.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　Isshin

###9220
A note left by a dead and rotting man in the Abandoned Dungeon.

"Supposedly the fragrant stone is enshrined in a village in the Ashina Depths.  But how to interpet 'throw oneself'?
This is as far as that old Okami tome could take me. But did they truly reach the Fountainhead Palace?  I'd like to know, but it seems I never will.  Kotaro... forgive me..."

###9221
A memo detailing the whereabouts of a kodachi short sword known as Sabimaru.

Must be purchased to read the content.

###9222
A memo detailing the whereabouts of a kodachi short sword known as Sabimaru.
The ancient kodachi Sabimaru can be found within Ashina Castle, enshrined in the bottom floor of the keep.
Sabimaru was wielded in wars of old,
and is a national treasure of Ashina.  
Supposedly the blade's poisonous blue rust could drive off even the inhuman Okami warrior women.

###9223
A note about apparitions in the Sunken Valley.

Must be purchased to read the content.

###9224
A note about apparitions in the Sunken Valley.
"Apparitions have been sighted in the
Guardian Ape of the Sunken Valley's old den.  Angry spirits, with many faces.
The Guardian Ape's old den can be found
at the bottom of the Sunken Valley, not far 
from the Forest of Mist.
Also, some reported they could hear the
